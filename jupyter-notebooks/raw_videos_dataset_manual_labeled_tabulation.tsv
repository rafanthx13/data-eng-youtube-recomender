From a skills perspective, this means that data engineers specialize in ETLs (extract, transform, load), automation (usually with Python or other programming languages), data modeling/data warehousing, SQL and NoSQL data manipulation, and data visualization, to name a few.  The skills that are less known are skills like ETLs and data warehousing. Both of these are usually discussed more in master‚Äôs or certificate programs after getting your bachelor‚Äôs degree ‚Äî although we suspect this will or has already changed.  More than likely you will need to learn these skills in some form of order.

The goals of a data engineer are much more big-picture and development focused. Data engineers build automated systems and model data structures to allow data to be efficiently processed.  This means the goal of a data engineer is to create and develop tables and data pipelines to support analytical dashboards and other data customers (like data scientists, analysts, and other engineers).   It's similar to most engineers. There is a lot of design, assumptions, limitations, and development that occurs to be able to create some sort of final robust system.

We'll talk about becoming a data engineer, focusing on who the data engineer is, what they do, how much they make, and what education and skills you need to become one.  Who‚Äôs the data engineer and what do they do?  Data engineers are the Jedi Knights of data science. They rely on a blend of analysis, wisdom, experience, and judgment to make key decisions for a company‚Äôs success. A data engineer is a self-starter who is inspired to complete more than your usual number of tasks.  Data engineers are the ones to take things further up the data science pipeline. They use the data architects‚Äô work as a steppingstone and then pre-processes the available data. These are the people who ensure the data is clean and organized and ready for the analysts to take over.  Data engineers also implement complex, large scale big data projects with a focus on collecting, managing, analyzing and visualizing large data sets. They are also the ones who turn raw data into insights using various tool sets, techniques, and cloud-based platforms.  That said, for a data engineer, knowledge of data modeling for both data warehousing and Big Data is a must, along with experience in the Big Data space (Hadoop Stack like M/R, HDFS, Pig, Hive, etc.). Of course, the ability to write, analyze, and debug SQL queries will helps the aspiring data engineer score high on any employer‚Äôs recruitment list.  In terms of soft skills, they are great team-players. A data engineer knows how to actively collaborate with data scientists and executives to build solutions and platforms that meet, or even exceed a company‚Äôs business needs!  ‚ñ∫ Consider hitting the SUBSCRIBE button if you LIKE the content: https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1    ‚ñ∫ VISIT our website: https://bit.ly/365ds    ü§ù Connect with us LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience/    365 Data Science is an online educational career website that offers the incredible opportunity to find your way into the data science world no matter your previous knowledge and experience.

It's commonly confused with machine learning, data science etc., when in fact data engineering is quite a distinct area of technology.  So, what do big data engineers do?  The job revolves around bringing new data to the company (ETL process if you like) and then maintaining the data flow!   Is data engineering a good career choice in 2020? Long story short - yes. As the amount of data we produce is growing rapidly, so is the demand for data professionals. However, my prediction is that many of the current data engineering tasks might get standardised, and eventually automated in the future. But hey, this is the XXI century! We'll have to learn new skills and adapt all the time!  -------  If you'd like to learn data engineering, I recommend following the 4 simple steps below to land you the first job interview:  In this long-awaited Airflow for Beginners video I'm showing you how to install Airflow from scratch, and how to schedule your first ETL job in Airflow!   We will run the Spotify ETL job that we created in my Data Engineering Course for Beginners. But if you have your own code to schedule in Airflow - feel free to use it instead!  In this Airflow tutorial I just wanted to get you started with Airflow, because I know that configuring Airflow can be non-trivial. I won't be going in-depth into all Airflow's features, so hopefully this tutorial will be as beginners friendly as it can get!   I'll show you how to fix some installation errors, how to set up your project folders, how to edit Airflow config file and where it sits, and how to write your first DAG file!   Get ready for a ride!  Oh, but grab some useful links first:  -github code repo: https://github.com/karolina-sowinska/free-data-engineering-course-for-beginners -Airflow quick start guide: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/start.html -Spotify access token: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/  Don't forget to subscribe if you're new here, more content is coming! :)  --------- If you'd like to learn data engineering, I recommend following the 4 simple steps below to land you the first job interview:  1.

In order to dive in further into big data, we need to understand how one can work on it ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where data engineering comes in.  If you want to learn more about data engineering, check out DataCamp's data engineering bootcamp.  * https://bit.ly/3i1XqsK  Now back to the intro:  Simply put, data engineering is all about managing big datasets and extracting information from them efficiently and accurately. What‚Äôs a Data Engineer?  A data engineer is someone who‚Äôs responsible for maintaining and building the architecture of data in a DS project.  Some of the main roles and responsibilities of a data engineer include having to ensure an uninterrupted flow of data between server and application, integrating new data management software, improving data foundational processes, and building data pipelines.  The truth is there are lots of various technologies and concepts that data engineers need to take on ‚Äî working with cloud computing, ETLs, data warehouses, and so much more.  The requirement of data engineers is constantly expanding, and thus we constantly need to continue learning what is changing in the technology world.

Over the course of the four videos, we are going to cover the entire ETL process (extract, transform, load), and at the end we are also going to talk about job scheduling.    In this course you will build your first data feed (or data pipeline) using Spotify API. This feed will run daily, and it will download the data about the songs that you listened to during a day, and save that data in a SQLite database on your local machine.   In this video we are going to cover the Extract stage of the ETL process, which means that we will be learning how to download data from a data vendor (Spotify in this case). Along the way I will also explain many basic data engineering concepts such as data formats (csv, json, XML...), API vs FTP methods of downloading data and the difference between compressed and uncompressed data.

More than a video, you'll learn hands-on coding & quickly apply skills to your daily work.  --- Hi. My name is Vincent. I'm a Data and Software Engineer at DataCamp. If you've ever heard of data science, there's a good chance you've heard of data engineering as well. This course will help you take your first steps in the world of data engineering. All very exciting, so let's get started!.  In the first chapter, we'll start off by introducing the concept of data engineering. In the second chapter, you'll learn more about the tools data engineers use. The third chapter is all about Extracting, Transforming and Loading data, or ETL. Finally, you'll get to have a peek behind the curtain in the case study on data engineering at DataCamp. But first, let's understand what data engineers do!  Imagine this: you've been hired as a data scientist at a young startup. Tasked with predicting customer churn, you want to use a fancy machine learning technique that you have been honing for years. However, after a bit of digging around, you realize all of your data is scattered around many databases. Additionally, the data resides in tables that are optimized for applications to run, not for analyses. To make matters worse, some legacy code has caused a lot of the data to be corrupt. In your previous company, you never really had this problem, because all the data was available to you in an orderly fashion. You're getting desperate. In comes the data engineer to the rescue.  It is the data engineer's task to make your life as a data scientist easier. Do you need data that currently comes from several different sources? No problem, the data engineer extracts data from these sources and loads it into one single database ready to use. At the same time, they've optimized the database scheme so it becomes faster to query. They also removed corrupt data. In this sense, the data engineer is one of the most valuable people in a data-driven company that wants to scale up.  Back in 2015, DataCamp published an infographic on precisely this: who does what in the data science industry. In this infographic, we described a data engineer as "an engineer that develops, constructs, tests, and maintains architectures such as databases and large-scale processing systems." A lot has changed since then, but the definition still holds up. The data engineer is focused on processing and handling massive amounts of data, and setting up clusters of machines to do the computing.  Typically, the tasks of a data engineer consist of developing a scalable data architecture, streamlining data acquisition, setting up processes that bring data together from several sources and safeguarding data quality by cleaning up corrupt data. Typically, the data engineer also has a deep understanding of cloud technology. They generally are experienced using cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.  Compare this with the tasks of a data scientist, who spend their time mining for patterns in data, applying statistical models on large datasets, building predictive models using machine learning, developing tools to monitor essential business processes, or cleaning data by removing statistical outliers. Data scientist typically have a deep understanding of the business itself.  Let's see if you can recognize the qualities of a data engineer in the exercises.

I got to thinking, what does this mean for the data domain as a whole. Is this a good thing? Why is it happening now?   For the most part, data engineering is upstream from data science. The work that they do building data warehouses and data pipelines allows data analysts, data scientists, and ml engineers to build models and create insights from data. Why is this domain, that should precede data science, growing in popularity AFTER data science did?   For better or for worse, the world doesn‚Äôt always work linearly. Data science became sexy because many of the top technology companies were making gobs of money with it. Non-Tech companies saw the value that data science and machine learning was providing and they soon followed suit.   Unfortunately for many of these companies following the trend, they didn‚Äôt have the data infrastructure to properly leverage data scientists.   I believe the massive uptick in data engineering‚Äôs popularity comes from many less technical companies realizing that they made a massive mistake. They needed to hire people to fix their data before hiring all these data scientists.   0:00 Intro 0:35 Infatuation with Data Science 1:39 Top Tech Companies vs Everyone Else 2:25 The Big (Data) Mistake 3:12 Is this a Good Thing? 4:10 Why Now? 5:22 Should YOU Become a Data Engineer? 6:45 HILARIOUS Data Engineering Joke  Video From @Sundas Khalid  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN_eu04kXhk&ab_channel=SundasKhalid  Video from @Seattle Data Guy  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpaFPPByOhM&list=PLXRKPZRrlvE5DEOn2LsCMld8F0TsFc_Dh&index=9&ab_channel=SeattleDataGuy  Other articles Referenced:  - https://medium.com/bitgrit-data-science-publication/why-is-data-engineering-popular-now-4e41b9f80cf4 - https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/o0z8s5/why_is_data_engineering_popular_now/    #DataScience #KenJee #DataEngineering  ‚≠ï Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 üéô Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast üï∏ Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/ ‚úçÔ∏èSign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter üìö Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)  Partners & Affiliates  üåü 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY üåü Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee  MORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE: üê§My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS üëî LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ üìà Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee üìë Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee üíª Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers üèÄ My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com  Check These Videos Out Next!

There are two aspects to this question that I'd like to discuss: 1. What routes are there to becoming a data engineer 2. What skills do you need to start applying to data engineering jobs  Watch the video for more details, but just to give you a brief overview, there are three routes to becoming a data engineer: 1. Technology Graduate Schemes 2. Data Consultancies 3. Junior Data Engineering positions  And when it comes to data engineering skills that you should have on your CV,  I think it'd be hard to get by without Python, SQL, basic database knowledge and a little bit of Linux.

Combined, we refer to these tables as a ‚Äúmulti-hop‚Äù architecture. It allows data engineers to build a pipeline that begins with raw data as a ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù from which everything flows. In this session, we will show how to build a scalable data engineering data pipeline using Delta Lake.  Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. Delta Lake offers ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing. It runs on top of your existing data lake and is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs.  In this session you will learn about: - The data engineering pipeline architecture - Data engineering pipeline scenarios - Data engineering pipeline best practices - How Delta Lake enhances data engineering pipelines - The ease of adopting Delta Lake for building your data engineering pipelines  See full Getting Started with Delta Lake tutorial series here: https://databricks.com/getting-started-with-delta-lake-tutorial-series/

Such an approach makes automated testing for data reliability almost impossible and leads to ineffective and time-consuming manual ETL monitoring.  Software engineering decouples code dependency, enables automated testing, and powers engineers to design, deploy, and serve reliable data in a module manner. As a consequence, the organization is able to easily reuse and maintain its ETL code base.  In this presentation, we discuss the challenges data engineers face when it comes to data reliability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how software engineering best practices help to build code modularity and automated testings for modern data engineering pipelines.  What you‚Äôll learn: ‚Äì Software engineering best practices in ETL projects: design patterns and modularity ‚Äì Automate ETL testings for data reliability: unit test, functional test, and end2end test.

There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions on statistics, programming and machine learning.  Before we get started, there‚Äôs one tip I‚Äôd like to share.  If we just look at data science interview you will notice that there are several types of interviews that companies conduct.  Some data science interviews are very product and metric driven. These interviews focus more on asking product questions like what kind of metrics would you use to show what you should improve in a product. These are often paired with SQL and some Python questions.  The other type of data science interview tends to be a mix of programming and machine learning.  We recommend asking the recruiter if you aren‚Äôt sure which type of interview you will be facing. Some companies are very good at keeping interviews consistent, but even then, teams can deviate depending on what they are looking for. Here are some examples of what we have noticed about some companies data science interviews.  Airbnb ‚Äî Product heavy, metrics diagnostics, metrics creation, A/B testing, tons of behavioral questions and take home material.  Netflix ‚Äî Product-sense questions, A/B testing, experimental design, metric design  Microsoft ‚Äî Programming heavy, binary tree traversal, SQL, machine learning  Expedia ‚Äî Product, programming, SQL, product sense, machine learning questions about SVM, regression and decision tree  0:00 Intro 1:24 The Data Science And Data Engineering Guides 2:13 Why I Made These Interview Guides 3:20 Track Your Study Progress 3:50 Diving Into The Data Science Guide 6:15 Final Tips For Tech Interviews 7:40 Vote On Next Weeks Videos  If you need data consulting help, then reach out to our team here: https://www.theseattledataguy.com/‚Äã  Also, if you'd like to read up on my updates about the data field, then you can sign up for our newsletter here. https://seattledataguy.substack.com/‚Äã  Check out my Medium here: https://medium.com/@SeattleDataGuy‚Äã

The goals of a data engineer are much more big-picture and development focused. Data engineers build automated systems and model data structures to allow data to be efficiently processed.  This means the goal of a data engineer is to create and develop tables and data pipelines to support analytical dashboards and other data customers (like data scientists, analysts, and other engineers).   It's similar to most engineers. There is a lot of design, assumptions, limitations, and development that occurs to be able to create some sort of final robust system.  0:00 Intro 0:24 What is a data engineer? 3:46 The End  If you need data consulting help, then reach out to our team here: https://www.theseattledataguy.com/‚Äã  Also, if you'd like to read up on my updates about the data field, then you can sign up for our newsletter here. https://seattledataguy.substack.com/‚Äã  Check out my Medium here: https://medium.com/@SeattleDataGuy‚Äã

Therefore, just as the best business executives are desperate to hire the best data scientists, data scientists are desperate to hire the best data engineers, the people who provide them with the tools and the data they need to get their jobs done. As important and interdependent as the two functions are, there is still a great deal of misunderstanding about the boundaries between the roles and the different constraints that each is operating under. I would like to spend a little bit of time describing how I think that data engineers and data scientists should be organized within a company and discussing how you can be the kind of data scientist/engineer that every data engineer/scientist wants to work with.  Josh Wills is the head of data engineering at Slack. Prior to Slack, he built and led data science teams at Cloudera and Google.

Take the full course at https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-engineering at your own pace. More than a video, you'll learn hands-on coding & quickly apply skills to your daily work.  ---  Hello again. Great job on the exercises! You should now have a good understanding of what it means to be a data engineer. The data engineer moves data from several sources, processes or cleans it and finally loads it into an analytical database. They do this using several tools. This video acts as an overview to get a feeling for how data engineers fulfill their tasks using these tools. We'll spend some more time to go into the details in the second chapter.  First, data engineers are expert users of database systems. Roughly speaking, a database is a computer system that holds large amounts of data. You might have heard of SQL or NoSQL databases. If not, there are some excellent courses on DataCamp on these subjects. Often, applications rely on databases to provide certain functionality. For example, in an online store, a database holds product data like prices or amount in stock.  On the other hand, other databases hold data specifically for analyses. You'll find out more about the difference in later chapters. For now, it's essential to understand that the data engineer's task begins and ends at databases.  Second, data engineers use tools that can help them quickly process data. Processing data might be necessary to clean or aggregate data or to join it together from different sources. Typically, huge amounts of data have to be processed. That is where parallel processing comes into play. Instead of processing the data on one computer, data engineers use clusters of machines to process the data. Often, these tools make an abstraction of the underlying architecture and have a simple API.  Third, scheduling tools help to make sure data moves from one place to another at the correct time, with a specific interval. Data engineers make sure these jobs run in a timely fashion and that they run in the right order. Sometimes processing jobs need to run in a particular order to function correctly. For example, tables from two databases might need to be joined together after they are both cleaned. In the following diagram, the JoinProductOrder job needs to run after CleanProduct and CleanOrder ran.  Luckily all of these tools are so common that there is a lot of choice in deciding which ones to use. In this slide, I'll present a few examples of each kind of tool. Please keep in mind this list is not exhaustive, and that some companies might choose to build their own tools in-house. Two examples of databases are MySQL or PostgreSQL. An example processing tool is Spark or Hive. Finally, for scheduling, we can use Apache Airflow, Oozie, or we can use the simple bash tool: cron.  To sum everything up, you can think of the data engineering pipeline through this diagram. It extracts all data through connections with several databases, transforms it using a cluster computing framework like Spark, and loads it into an analytical database. Also, everything is scheduled to run in a specific order through a scheduling framework like Airflow.  A small side note here is that the sources can be external APIs or other file formats too. We'll see this in the exercises.  Enough talking, let's do some exercises!

The reasons are typically a combination of project management, leadership, organisation, available competence, and technical failures. In this presentation, I will focus on the technical aspects, and present the most common or costly data engineering mistakes that I have experienced when building scalable data processing technology over the last five years, as well as advice for how to avoid them. The presentation includes war stories from large scale production environments, some that lead to reprocessing of petabytes of data, or DDoSing critical services with a Hadoop cluster, and what we learnt from the incidents.

To make a good comparison between Machine Learning vs Data Engineering, we first need to clarify what we mean by these two areas.  Machine Learning can be actually split into two separate "camps":  -scientists (data scientists, machine learning researchers, machine learning scientists) -engineers (machne learning engineers).  And data engineers are always engineers :)   So in this video I compare scientists, machine learning engineers and data engineers :) I hope this will help you to decide on a career path!   As always, any questions, let me know in the comments.  Find me on instagram: @karo_sowinska  You can warm my heart with a cup of coffee as a thanks!... :) https://ko-fi.com/karolina_sowinska

Interviewing for any technical position generally requires preparing, studying, and long, all-day interviews.  Data engineering interviews, like other technical interviews, require plenty of preparation. There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions.  Some positions require Hadoop, others SQL. Some roles require understanding statistics, while still others require heavy amounts of system design.  We have gathered many of the resources that we have used to study and get jobs at companies in the FAANG family as well as other major tech companies. We have yet to find one that requires you to know anything about Hadoop during the interview, so that has not been included in this study guide.

This answer can vary depending on which company and or team you are working on.  In some cases data engineers are more like software engineers that focus on data.  In other cases data engineers are more like BI developers.  This wide range makes it difficult for data engineers as well as companies to really articulate what they want and their skill sets.  Hopefully this video helps discuss some of those differences.  This was the Linkedin Live Where I Matt, Joe and I were asked what is the difference between a software engineer vs. data engineer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAJBCuE2VcU  0:00 Intro 1:45 The Software Engineer With A Data Focus 3:20 Data Engineers At Start-Ups And Non-Tech Companies 3:56 How Data Engineers And Software Engineers Solve Problems 6:01 Salary - Data Engineer Vs Software Engineer 6:45  Skill Sets - Data Engineer Vs Software Engineer 8:08 What Do Other People Say About Software Engineers Vs Data Engineers 8:49 The BI Developer Data Engineer 10:40 Key Takeaways  If you need data consulting help, then reach out to our team here: https://www.theseattledataguy.com/‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã  Also, if you'd like to read up on my updates about the data field, then you can sign up for our newsletter here. https://seattledataguy.substack.com/‚Äã  Check out my Medium here: https://medium.com/@SeattleDataGuy‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã  Watch our video on the skills you need to be a data engineer then you can watch the one below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSHaOvNodA&t=5s

We will run the Spotify ETL job that we created in my Data Engineering Course for Beginners. But if you have your own code to schedule in Airflow - feel free to use it instead!  In this Airflow tutorial I just wanted to get you started with Airflow, because I know that configuring Airflow can be non-trivial. I won't be going in-depth into all Airflow's features, so hopefully this tutorial will be as beginners friendly as it can get!   I'll show you how to fix some installation errors, how to set up your project folders, how to edit Airflow config file and where it sits, and how to write your first DAG file!   Get ready for a ride!  Oh, but grab some useful links first:  -github code repo: https://github.com/karolina-sowinska/free-data-engineering-course-for-beginners -Airflow quick start guide: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/start.html -Spotify access token: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/  Don't forget to subscribe if you're new here, more content is coming! :)  --------- If you'd like to learn data engineering, I recommend following the 4 simple steps below to land you the first job interview:  1. Learn Python I recommend following the Python for Everybody specialization course on Coursera, which is one of the most popular courses there: https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=kOQH55A53NA&offerid=916798.1560499266&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fpython  2. Learn SQL SQL is still the lingua franca of data. I recommend going with Learn SQL Basics for Data Science course, because it contains some chapters which are very releavant to data engineering in partcular, e.g. distributed computing with Spark https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=kOQH55A53NA&offerid=759505.15198708466&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Flearn-sql-basics-data-science  3. Learn Bash scripting/Linux I wouldn't take a full course on it, but at least read a good article. if you do prefer to take a course/guided project, I think this one is short and good: https://www.coursera.org/projects/command-line-linux  4. Learn how to develop on the cloud, e.g. on AWS There are a few good courses around there, but I think the Coursera one is the most comprehensive  https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=kOQH55A53NA&offerid=759505.18533796022&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Faws-fundamentals  DISCLOSURE:  The above contain affiliate links, meaning when you click the links and make a purchase, I receive a commission.

Recently, we introduced Big Data Tools ‚Äì a new IntelliJ IDEA plugin which integrates Spark and provides support for editing and running Zeppelin notebooks. This is why we've invited Jeff Zhang, an experienced data engineer, famous speaker, and contributor to big data related projects including Apache Zeppelin, to host a webinar.   Together, we explore what data engineering is about, what purpose it has, what the buzzword ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù really stands for, and importantly, some examples of developer tools that are most instrumental and productive in doing data engineering. We dive into how data engineering contributes to Machine Learning and Exploratory Data Analysis, and what place #Spark, #Hadoop, #Zeppelin, and some other open-source tools occupy in the data engineering industry.

He is an open source veteran, start to use hadoop since 2009 and is PMC of several Apache projects Tez/Livy/Zeppelin and committer of Apache Pig. His past experience is not only on big data infrastructure, but also on how to leverage these big data tools to get insight. He speaks several times on big data conferences like hadoop summit, strata + hadoop world. Now he works in Alibaba Group as a staff engineer. Prior that he works in Hortonworks where he developed these popular big data tools.

You can work with different data sources with the same set of API in both batch and streaming mode. Such flexibility is great if you are experienced Spark developer solving a complicated data engineering problem, which might include ML or streaming. In Airbnb, 95% of all data pipelines are daily batch jobs, which read from Hive tables and write to Hive tables. For such jobs, you would like to trade some flexibility for more extensive functionality around writing to Hive or multiple days processing orchestration. Another advantage of reducing flexibility is creating ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô, which can be followed by less experienced data engineers.  In AirBnB we‚Äôve created a framework called ‚ÄòSputnik‚Äô, which tries to address these issues. Data engineers need to extend the sputnik base class and write code for data transformation without bothering about the filtering of dates for which the job would run. End users do not read or write to Hive directly, they use Sputnik wrappers for Hive. Read wrapper filters input data based on parameters from the console including the time frame. Write wrapper get information about result table from case class annotations, writes meta-information about the table, makes verifications on the data and much more. The core idea of the framework is that all functionality of the job consists of job-specific logic and run-specific logic. Job specific logic is a transformation defined by data engineer and meta information about the tables. Run specific logic is filtering input data based on current date and writing data to Hive. Data Engineer needs to specify job-specific logic, and Sputnik handles all run specific logic based on assumptions about the right way of operating daily Hive batch jobs. https://github.com/airbnb/sputnik  About:  Databricks provides a unified data analytics platform, powered by Apache Spark‚Ñ¢, that accelerates innovation by unifying data science, engineering and business.

And these three roles can sometimes confuse data science aspirants. In this video, we will go over the differences between the three roles, skill set required in each of these roles and salary expectations.   What is data engineer? Data engineer is responsible for maintaining data infrastructure, data pipelines, data warehouse, data modeling, etc.   What is data analyst? Data analyst uses the data warehouse to run analysis on top of it using enterprise business intelligence tools such as Tableau, Power BI, etc. He is also an expert in excel and business domain.   What is data scientist? Data scientist, on the other hand, has all skills of data analyst plus strong statistical skills and machine learning skills which makes him a perfect person who can build machine learning and deep learning models for predictive analysis and generate detailed insights for any business.  #DataAnalyst #DataEngineer #DataScientist  Website: http://codebasicshub.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/codebasicshub Twitter: https://twitter.com/codebasicshub

Power BI is not for data engineering.  Directly connecting large data sets to Power BI results in slow, clunky reports.    Instead of a direct connection to unprepared data, a series of tools should be used to maximize the efficiency of you available data. Sure you can work with a small, clean data set and churn out beautiful, interactive visuals, but data sets usually tend to grow.  Watch here and learn about designing systems to deliver faster and more accurate results.  The proper design should start with a data collection tool or set of tools such as webforms or data mining programs, storage such as a SQL or NoSQL database/data lake, an ETL process, and finally a visualization tool such as Power BI or Tableau.  You can always add more parts to this system.  Many organizations add machine learning and predictive analytics, but this is the base of all proper data science systems.

Along the way I learned how to operate on an engineering team.  How to follow good engineering practices and just in general, develop maintainable systems.  Now that companies are starting to hire even more rapidly for data engineers, I wanted to provide my story for how I went from being a data analyst to data engineer.  From taking the initiative to develop products, to self learning. All of it was required to really challenge myself to be a DE.  Thanks for reading and good luck on your data engineering journey.  Tags: Data engineering projects, Data engineer project ideas, data project sources, data analytics project sources, data project portfolio  About Me:  I  have spent his career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consults on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.  *I do participate in affiliate programs, if a link has an "*" by it, then I may receive a small portion of the proceeds at no extra cost to you.

Prior to Slack, he built and led data science teams at Cloudera and Google. He is the founder of the Apache Crunch project, co-authored an O‚ÄôReilly book on advanced analytics with Apache Spark, and wrote a popular tweet about data scientists.  Abstract Summary:  I Build The Black Box: Grappling with Product and Policy:   The rate of improvement in techniques for building machine learning models over the past 2 years has been astounding; between generalized embedding models like starspace and scalable, portable classifiers like XGBoost now mean that we can compress months of work into days or even hours. Unfortunately, we have not had any similar improvements in our ability to solve the product and policy problems that so often go hand-in-hand with building and deploying models; if anything, our reliance on self-optimizing black box techniques means that these problems are only getting harder, and as we bring machine learning to bear on more diverse domains, the stakes are only getting higher.

This is an informative video describing the difference between a Data Scientist and a Data Engineer (Data Scientist vs Data Engineer). What is the difference between a data scientist and a data engineer? A data scientist is someone, who is generally good at mathematics and statistics. His proficiency in these subjects makes him a natural analyst. He knows programming and has a penchant for machine learning and artificial intelligence modelling. He has a thorough understanding of the domain he is operating in and uses it to gather business intelligence that can help his organization achieve success. Lastly, he is good at visually and verbally communicating insights from data with a variety of people, including team leaders and business stakeholders. The data engineer, on the other hand, is most likely a programmer from the past. He is proficient at Python, Java or Scala and adept at handling distributed systems for the analysis of voluminous big data. His primary responsibility is creating free-flowing data pipelines using various big data technologies for real-time or static data analytics. The two roles make use of similar skill sets. Safe to say, both - data scientists and data engineers work with big data. They both know programming and understand data analytics. Nonetheless, the data scientist is a better analyst than programmer, while the data engineer is a better programmer than analyst. The two roles are complementary, not interchangeable. They work best together when they are made to perform tasks that match their strengths instead of the others. With the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a new job role has emerged. The role of a machine learning engineer lies at the intersection between the roles of the data scientist and the data engineer. The machine learning engineer is most likely a data scientist or a data engineer, who has improved upon their weaker skills. He is a data scientist with better programming skills or a data engineer with better analytical skills. Having said that, he is still better at one of these skills than the other. The machine learning engineer is responsible for optimizing programs and systems for machine learning. He is the one of the latest additions to the long list of data professionals.

Bringing up the subject is a sure way to instantly clear the room at a party or make your friends groan in despair. The work includes a lot of complicated tools, many, many lines of code, and a not-insignificant amount of gnashing of teeth. But what if I told you there is a way to quickly, easily, and cheaply do both data engineering and data exploration on most data without even having to import it into a database? What if I told you that Azure Synapse has a just about magical tool that can instantly connect to flat files and make them available as nice, well-behaved tables? I'm talking about Azure Synapse serverless pools, a great tool for both initial exploration and surprisingly complex data engineering. I'll walk you through what it is, how to set it up, and give you a few examples of basic data exploration, as well as a tad more complex data engineering. Oh, and did I mention you can actually store the end result in several different formats as well...?  0:00 Introduction 0:56 Azure Synapse Serverless Pools Overview 1:54 Demo 11:05 Getting started  ‚úîÔ∏è Resources: Andy Cutler‚Äôs blog on serverless pools: https://www.datahai.co.uk/tag/sql-serverless/ Andy Mallon‚Äôs blog on bucketing with T-SQL: https://am2.co/2019/10/how-to-create-date-buckets-in-t-sql/  About Alexander Arvidsson: Alexander is a principal solutions architect at Attollo in Sweden.

This talk will walk you through the process of moving your data to the finish fine to get that gold metal! A common data engineering pipeline architecture uses tables that correspond to different quality levels, progressively adding structure to the data: data ingestion ('Bronze' tables), transformation/feature engineering ('Silver' tables), and machine learning training or prediction ('Gold' tables). Combined, we refer to these tables as a 'multi-hop' architecture. It allows data engineers to build a pipeline that begins with raw data as a 'single source of truth' from which everything flows. In this session, we will show how to build a scalable data engineering data pipeline using Delta Lake, so you can be the champion in your organization.  About: Databricks provides a unified data analytics platform, powered by Apache Spark‚Ñ¢, that accelerates innovation by unifying data science, engineering and business.

188	Data Council	How Data Teams Do More With Less By Adopting Software Engineering Best Practices | GitLab	0	2018-12-30	g33ktalktv	2944	62	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eu623QBwakc/maxresdefault.webp	1920	1080	Science & Technology	Software Engineering Best Practices|building data teams|gitlab|thomas la piana gitlab	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAezwIIm1SfsqdmbQI-65pA	ABOUT THE TALK:  A high performance data team can be a force-multiplier for any organization. It is no secret that data and analytics teams usually don‚Äôt get the amount of resources and support that they desire. So how does one effect the most change with the smallest team and fewest resources possible? The best place to look for inspiration is software engineering.   It is our belief that data engineering, science, and analytics is a sub-field of software engineering. As this field matures we should avoid reinventing any wheels and learn from the best practices of software engineering and DevOps. The proliferation of high-quality open source data tools is making this easier than ever.  ABOUT THE SPEAKER:  Thomas La Piana is a Data Engineer at GitLab. GitLab is a single application for the entire devops life-cycle. From CI/CD to security and monitoring, GitLab provides tools to cover everything. Previously, Thomas was a Data Engineer for OrderMyGear, a Dallas, TX based startup focused on revolutionizing the team sports apparel industry.  Thomas graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas with a Bachelors in Political Science. He wrote and presented two papers on Chinese politics before deciding that software is what he was truly passionate about.

For many data-related positions such as data science, data engineering or machine learning, median salaries and numbers of job openings have changed. Unfortunately in many cases they have changed for the worse.   Should we panic?   In my opinion, things will gently get back to normal, as they always do after a crisis. More info in the video!

Indeed, successful deployment of data science in any organization is closely tied to how data is stored and processed. This course introduces the fundamentals of data storage, retrieval, and processing systems in the context of common data analytics processing needs. As these fundamentals are introduced, representative technologies will be used to illustrate how to construct storage and processing architectures. This course aims to provide a set of ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù by which one can construct a complete architecture for storing and processing data. The course will examine how technical architectures vary depending on the problem to be solved and the reliability and freshness of the result.  The course considers the complete breadth of technology choices. The content spans from traditional databases and business warehouse architectures, so-called big-data architectures, to streaming analytics solutions and graph processing. Students will consider both small and large datasets because both are equally important and both justify different trade-offs. Exercises and examples will consider both simple and complex data structures, as well as data that is both clean and structured and dirty and unstructured.

Once that data is available, the goal of a data scientist is to combine those different data sources into a derived data layer to bring extra value. The business logic behind that derived layer is created by data scientists as their job is to translate business use case into code. To enforce data engineering best practices, we created a small framework to allow data scientists to quickly create and test derived data pipeline that fits directly into our data lake.

Along the way I learned how to operate on an engineering team.  How to follow good engineering practices and just in general, develop maintainable systems.  Now that companies are starting to hire even more rapidly for data engineers, I wanted to provide my story for how I went from being a data analyst to data engineer.  From taking the initiative to develop products, to self learning. All of it was required to really challenge myself to be a DE.  Thanks for reading and good luck on your data engineering journey.  Tags: Data engineering projects, Data engineer project ideas, data project sources, data analytics project sources, data project portfolio   About Me:  I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consults on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.  *I do participate in affiliate programs, if a link has an "*" by it, then I may receive a small portion of the proceeds at no extra cost to you.

The building industry is exploding with data sources that impact the energy performance of the built environment and health and well-being of occupants. Spreadsheets just don‚Äôt cut it anymore as the sole analytics tool for professionals in this field. Participating in mainstream data science courses might provide skills such as programming and statistics, however the applied context to buildings is missing, which is the most important part for beginners.  This course focuses on the development of data science skills for professionals specifically in the built environment sector. It targets architects, engineers, construction and facilities managers with little or no previous programming experience. An introduction to data science skills is given in the context of the building life cycle phases. Participants will use large, open data sets from the design, construction, and operations of buildings to learn and practice data science techniques.  Essentially this course is designed to add new tools and skills to supplement spreadsheets. Major technical topics include data loading, processing, visualization, and basic machine learning using the Python programming language, the Pandas data analytics and sci-kit learn machine learning libraries, and the web-based Colaboratory environment. In addition, the course will provide numerous learning paths for various built environment-related tasks to facilitate further growth.

With more than a decade of Big Data experience now behind us, we‚Äôll talk with a few veterans from the front lines about what skills mattered ‚Äî and what didn't ‚Äî on the first data engineering teams at Silicon Valley‚Äôs data-intensive start-ups. This will be a must-watch panel for those looking to build out a data-engineering function or get into the field themselves.  We‚Äôll explore the build vs. buy debate, looking at which classes of software teams hand-rolled, borrowed (and extended) from open-source projects, or bought - and discuss how that mix is changing. We‚Äôll learn about the hardest parts of data pipelines and the data stack to build. And we‚Äôll highlight the necessary skills that make data engineers different than data scientists.

Right from data engineers to ML engineers to data scientists to machine learning scientists to data analysts and even business analysts. And there is often confusing which role to pick. People often say I come from a certain background and not sure which path to take and I think having a mentor really helps in these situations to figure out what opportunities to pursue given a particular background and what is the course of action to be taken to reach there. While a lot of data is available online, in fact, to pick up data science, mentorships even helps to understand you know keep track of progress and get a more high-level idea on what are the kind of project you want to do if you want to land in a certain kind of job and also what are the kind of domains you want to pick based on your experience. So I think having a mentor and having a little bit of that extra advice goes a long way in making the right decision. So there are multiple types of roles in the data science industry and there is a lot of confusion around them, so let me clear that out. Data science is a multidisciplinary field which involves skills from statistics, probability, machine learning, software engineering and combinations of these result in different titles and roles which might confuse people. Broadly there are roles like data engineer, infrastructure engineer, so their roles are not typically data science roles but they are more of a support system around data scientists. They help data scientist do their job. So when it comes to data science there are three categories, even though there is still confusion around them but gradually some clarity is coming up. So data science role, there are three roles. The first role is a data analyst role, the data analyst is a person who is responsible for reporting, summarizing data, using basic statistics in SQL and Python to help business decision-makers take those decisions and also help data scientist do that projects. So typically this role is..companies do hire for these roles, almost every company hire for this kind of role. The second role is more of a data scientist which goes a little deeper into the problem. They work on problems like fraud detection, recommender system where they work with much more scientific rigor than a data analyst. The typical skills which are required to do this thing are statistics, programming languages, machine learning and etc. But these people don‚Äôt have a strong background in software engineering so in a product based setup they pair up with a machine learning engineer to put that model into production which brings me to the third part which is the machine learning engineer. Machine learning engineer is a person who has a strong foundation in software engineering but also understands machine learning so that they can put the, in a product based setup these people can put machine learning models into production integrate with the core software. So coming to the companies that hire for these kinds of roles, so companies are hiring for data analysts also, data scientists also, machine learning engineers also.

(EX: Sign up form) Unstructured data  Data that is more loosely defined. (EX: Upload  a profile picture)  Database - Data store for usually structured data that is used for transaction   Data Warehouse - Aggregation of databases for analytical purposes Data Mart - Data warehouse for a specific business use case   Data Lake is a place where you can store any file format and dump data in.   Processing requirements buzzwords.  ACID - atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability OLTP - availability, speed, concurrency and recoverability  OLAP - consolidation, drill-down, and slicing and dicing   Key-value data store: (python dict/java hash map) Index/ Key : a unique identifier that represents and links to some other data.  Partition: a sub table that is logically divided by a column Caching: storing the result of an operation for anticipated future use  DAG/ Pipeline: series of steps where one step cannot lead to a previous step taken in the series.

We plan and execute the project, produce the results...and then don't come close to meeting our users' needs. A flurry of follow ups are then scheduled to to address this as deadlines loom.   This talk explores the practice of data engineering to address these gaps. Whether it's machine learning or identifying particular care needs or troubleshooting data problems at scale, we can more quickly understand and improve such shortcomings. The end is a system that can be adapted to new needs with speed and confidence that we couldn't achieve otherwise.

How to Become a Data Engineer In 2021 | In this data engineering video, I will highlight one of the core skill sets required for a data engineer. About 50% of time can be spent on data cleanup (data cleansing or wrangling) and ETL operations before the data is eventually loaded into the enterprise application. Data formats also play a big role during migrations. A data engineer needs to understand various data formats such as flat files, XML, JSON and HL7 (for healthcare) in order to ensure data is clean and has consistency, accuracy, integrity and completeness.

Additional ingestions from data sources are frequently added on an as-needed basis, making it difficult to leverage shared functionality between pipelines. Identifying when technical debt is prohibitive for an organization can be difficult, but remedying it can be even more so. As the Zillow data engineering team grappled with their own technical debt, they identified the need for higher data quality enforcement, the consolidation of shared pipeline functionality, and a scalable way to implement complex business logic for their downstream data scientists and machine learning engineers.  In this talk, the Zillow team explains how they designed their new end-to-end pipeline architecture to make the creation of additional pipelines robust, maintainable and scalable, all while writing fewer lines of code with Apache Spark.  Members of Zillow‚Äôs data engineering team discuss:  1. How they identified pain points in the development, maintenance, and scaling of their data pipelines 2. The advantages and disadvantages of the ETL patterns considered 3. How they ultimately leveraged their experience to architect more scalable, robust data pipelines using Apache Spark  About:  Databricks provides a unified data analytics platform, powered by Apache Spark‚Ñ¢, that accelerates innovation by unifying data science, engineering and business.

This is because SQL remains the language of data. So, in order to be data-driven, people need to know how to access and analyze data.  With so many people looking at, slicing, manipulating, and analyzing data, I wanted to provide some tips to help improve your SQL.  These tips and tricks I have picked up along the way while writing SQL. Some of them are do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts others are just best practices. Overall I hope that they will help bring your SQL to the next level.  #SQL #shorts #YouTubeShorts #SQLTips #60secondsWhiteboard #SQL #SQLtricks #SQLhacks

That's the biggest misconception. Data Engineering is the process of building automated systems to make different data available for Data Scientists!  Start by learning Python, SQL and Databases. Add a solid potion of data structures and algorithms to it and you are good to go to build your first data engineering project.

In this session, we introduce design patterns such as using Amazon S3 instead of HDFS, taking advantage of both long- and short-lived clusters, using notebooks, and other architectural best practices. We discuss lowering cost with Auto Scaling and Spot Instances, and security best practices for encryption and fine-grained access control. We showcase key improvements made to the service in 2020. We cover improvements in using the Amazon EMR API, best practices utilizing Spot instances and Spot Instances with Auto Scaling, improvements toward Amazon S3 performance on Amazon EMR, and security/authorization and authentication. We couple each of these with a demo or customer use case to illustrate the benefits. If you are an existing Amazon EMR user, you walk away with a thorough understanding of improvements made in 2020, and how they benefit you. If you are a new Amazon EMR user, get an understanding of common use cases and how other customers are using Amazon EMR.   Don't miss our future webinars!

Our data scientists are expected to develop and operate large machine learning workflows autonomously without the need to be deeply experienced with systems or data engineering. Instead, we provide them with delightfully usable ML infrastructure that they can use to manage a project's lifecycle. Our end-to-end ML infrastructure, Metaflow, was designed to leverage the strengths of AWS: elastic compute; high-throughput storage; and dynamic, scalable notebooks. In this session, we present our human-centric design principles that enable the autonomy our engineers enjoy.

More specifically you will learn how to use the Luigi framework to integrate multiple stages of a model building pipeline (collection, processing, vectorization, training of multiple models, and validation) all in Python!  As companies scale prototypes and ad hoc analyses into production systems, it is critical to build automated (and repeatable) systems for data collection/processing and model training /evaluation which are fault tolerant enough to adapt to changing constraints. Sustainable software development is often an afterthought for data scientists, especially since the tools for analysis (R, scientific python, etc.) do not naturally lend themselves to building scalable and extensible software abstractions. But now we can have our cake and eat it too... all with Python!  In this workshop you see how (and why) to leverage the PyData ecosystem to build a robust data pipeline. More specifically you will learn how to use the Luigi framework to integrate multiple stages of a model building pipeline: collection, processing, vectorization, training of multiple models, and validation.

You probably know that data is a huge part of how the world runs now, including how businesses report on metrics and how they operate.   One of the difficult parts of working with data is communicating enough context and information to everyone in the organization so they understand the data they're looking at and whether it answers their questions.  That's where dbt comes in. dbt is a data transformation and documentation tool that helps data analysts, data engineers, and business stakeholders collaborate on data.  This introduction to dbt will walk you through: a short history of ELT, what is dbt (data build tool), and dbt core concepts.  The core dbt concepts include: - Expressing transforms with SQL select - Automatically build the DAG with ref(s) - Tests ensure model accuracy - Documentation is accessible and easily updated - Use macros to write reusable SQL  Learn more about dbt at: https://getdbt.com https://twitter.com/getdbt  Learn more about dbt Labs (formerly Fishtown Analytics) at: https://www.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/about-us/ https://twitter.com/dbt_labs https://www.linkedin.com/company/dbtlabs  Register for Coalesce 2021‚ÄîThe Analytics Engineering Conference‚Äîto keep learning (it's free to attend!): https://bit.ly/Coalesce2021YT

Here we look at how the AGL Data team has responded to this challenge and built a highly scalable and modern Azure Cloud Data Asset. With over 17 years‚Äô experience across multiple data driven organisations, Tim is passionate about enabling and maintaining Data Assets that drive value across the organisations by enabling Data collaboration and scalable assets. While not focusing on Data initiative, Tim is busy with his many other interests in Central Victoria.  üé§ Jeff Chau, Senior Solutions Engineer, Splunk üé§ Eric Six, Principal Architect, Splunk Playing with Data Pipelines on Kafka, Pulsar and Flink Kafka is a widely used event streaming platform used for pub/sub messaging, but did you know about Pulsar and Flink, two other technologies under the Apache Software Foundation? With their powers combined, we now have the ability to collect and manipulate data streams of increasing magnitude and complexity. In this session, look to be introduced to Pulsar as an alternative in comparison to Kafka and Flink as a platform for sub-millisecond in-memory data stream processing. The key features of these technologies can be harnessed for ‚Äúdata pipeline visualisation‚Äù ‚Äì paving the way for more intuitive data stream management. See also the Data Stream Processing effort under way at Splunk. Jeff is a constant learner, most recently picking up data engineering at Splunk over the last couple of years to add to a background in DevOps and application performance engineering and web development.

Toespitst op het vak van business intelligence, ben jij de man of vrouw die ervoor zorgt, dat de beloftes van de IT organisatie ook worden waargemaakt. Jij bent de man of vrouw die de data inderdaad laat stromen en die ervoor zorgt dat het gewenste rapport ook daadwerkelijk wordt aangemaakt. Als data engineer heb je verschillende mogelijke rollen. Bij business intelligence halen we de benodigde data uit diverse databases en slaan we deze data op in een zogeheten ‚Äúdata warehouse‚Äù. Een andere rol is de rol van het implementeren van informatie producten. Het goed kunnen uitvoeren van het vak van data engineer vraagt een hoop. Je moet natuurlijk prima jouw weg weten in diverse databases. Daarnaast moet je dan een script kunnen ontwikkelen om de gevraagde gegevens eruit te halen. Als maker van informatie producten moet jij de tools, waarin dit gemaakt wordt, prima beheersen. Daarnaast moet je een goede gesprekspartner zijn van de business, om de wensen van de business in te kunnen bouwen in de informatie producten. In ons curriculum zijn diverse trainingen opgenomen om deze vaardigheden op te bouwen. Dit vraagt goede consultancy vaardigheden. In ons curriculum zijn diverse trainingen op het gebied van consultancy en communicatie opgenomen, die de data engineer prima kunnen helpen.

With no idea what that really meant, I accepted the challenge.  Getting your data to serve your organization fast enough and at scale can seem daunting. It‚Äôs tempting to see this as an engineering problem. You might even try to recruit a data engineer to solve this. But that is not your first step. Your first problem is a culture problem.  How might we make analytics a part of the company culture? Something that engineers care about as much as product managers?  In this talk, I‚Äôll walk through what I think it takes to build the mind sets, internal relationships, and knowledge to empower and develop a powerful data team. A team of curious, question-asking, story-telling analytical minds, that have enough technical capabilities to hack together complex and scattered data sets and extract and deliver insights. A group of people recently coined purple people.

This tutorial demonstrates how to identify and remove bad data with Numpy and Pandas.  Data cleansing is the process of removing bad data that may include outliers, missing entries, failed sensors, or other types of missing or corrupted information. Bad data can be detected with summary statistics and data visualization. An effective way to remove bad data is with filters that segregate based on conditions that remove outliers, replace bad values such as NaN (Not a Number), or remove the data row that contains an NaN value.  0:00 Data Cleansing 3:20 Numpy remove NaN 7:02 Pandas DataFrame 8:01 Pandas drop 8:23 Pandas fillna 9:13 Pandas filters 14:05 Data Engineering  Machine Learning for Engineers: https://apmonitor.com/pds Data Cleansing: https://apmonitor.com/pds/index.php/Main/CleanseData

As product development cycles have increased in velocity, though, I began to notice that changing data schemas were causing huge amounts of work in order to update downstream reporting for execs and other teams. Behavioral data is never static, but it is non-trivial to build a system that requires little or no maintenance for data engineers and analysts.  In this talk, I'll tell the story about our stack, our changing schemas and how I used dbt to make life easier for both the engineers instrumenting tracking as well as the executives consuming downstream reporting.

Learn SQL and be efficient with manipulating data in Python or R.  2) You don't always get to work on projects that are exciting to you. In school you choose many of the data sets and projects that you do. Almost universally, at work, your day to day projects are dictated by your boss.  3) You can learn a tremendous amount from other people. Data Scientists are incredibly smart and come from a range of backgrounds.   4) Data science is constantly growing. With the field being broadly defined, there is almost a limitless amount of things to learn.  5) Office politics do play a role in data science. If you are interested in management after data science, it could be good to know who makes the strategic decisions.   6) Data science is very different at different companies depending on the size and growth phase of the organization.  7) Put some time into learning implementation frameworks (Docker & Sagemaker)  8) Statistical significance plays a different role in the business setting. If the expected value is positive, you should at least try it.  #DataScience #KenJee   ‚≠ï Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 üéô Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast üï∏ Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/ ‚úçÔ∏èSign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter üìö Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)  Partners & Affiliates  üåü 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY üåü Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee  MORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE: üê§My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS üëî LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ üìà Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee üìë Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee üíª Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers üèÄ My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com  Check These Videos Out Next!

By leveraging best practices from DevOps and software engineering, we‚Äôve found that data teams can resolve broken pipelines faster, and long before stale dashboards, null values, or duplicate data issues impact downstream data consumers.  During this workshop, we‚Äôll share a five-step process analytics engineering teams can use to conduct root cause analysis in a collaborative, quick, and effective manner.

This transition takes some serious effort, but is definitely attainable!   In data science, you need a specific set of skills. From a business or economics background, you generally need to brush up on the coding and technical skills first.   You should focus on learning python or R first. You will also need to develop an understanding of SQL. There are some great free resources to learn these skills, but my favorite is kaggle.   Depending on your experience, you may have more success breaking into data science through the visualization and story telling route. Learning Tableau or Power BI can be an incredible asset for data science teams.   Generally, you can self study using online data science courses, or you can go back to graduate school to get a data science degree.    #KenJee   ‚≠ï Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 üéô Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast üï∏ Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/ ‚úçÔ∏èSign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter üìö Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)  Partners & Affiliates  üåü 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY üåü Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee  MORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE: üê§My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS üëî LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ üìà Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee üìë Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee üíª Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers üèÄ My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com  Check These Videos Out Next!

In this talk, we will discuss two of them, the AWS Data Pipeline managed service and the open source software Airflow. These frameworks have very different feature sets and operational models, however, they have both benefited us and fallen short of our needs in similar ways.  To understand the reasons, we analyze our experience of first building a data processing platform on Data Pipeline, and then developing the next generation platform on Airflow. We find that managed service and open source framework are leaky abstractions and thus both frameworks required us to understand and build primitives to support deployment and operations.  Likewise, we discuss the necessity of implementing cross-cutting aspects such as logging, monitoring, security and configuration, which arises from the shortcomings of existing pre-implemented components. Generalizing from specific pain points and solutions, we posit that almost any organization building a data platform using a pipeline framework or service will run into many of the same issues, because opinionated framework/service implementations will conflict with an organization's existing code, preferences and procedures.  So where is the line? What value can you expect to get from a data pipeline framework or service? What will you need to wrap, integrate with or fully implement yourself? To develop a robust data pipeline platform for your organization, you will need to bridge the gap between the framework dream and production reality. This talk will help you do that.

The Python process that reads the huge amount of data, before inserting into Postgres is able to process the incoming chunks by use of the stream=True option on the Requests module, and the iter_content method of the Request response. The mock 3rd party API, which hosts the potentially petabytes of data, makes use of the Flask stream_with_context method.

These solutions require a generic cluster scheduling layer to host multiple workloads such as Kafka, Spark and TensorFlow, alongside databases such as Cassandra, Elasticsearch and cloud-based storage.   Eliran Bivas is a senior big data architect with years of hands-on experience working on both big data and cloud native solutions. Eliran will go over a common solution framework to create cloud native end-to-end analytics applications. It involves using Kubernetes as an alternative to Yarn, running Spark, Presto, machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Python and Spark ML kits) and serverless functions coupled with local and cloud-based storage. The session will showcase customer use-cases from IoT, automotive, cloud SaaS and finance. It will also include a live solution demo which demonstrates the benefits of using big data and analytics over a cloud native architecture, eliminating the existing challenges of complexity and moving towards a continuous integration and development architecture for big data.  About Eliran Bivas Eliran Bivas is a senior big data architect at iguazio and a self-proclaimed tech junkie with a passion for innovation. Eliran is skilled with object-oriented design and development, having worked extensively on cloud native environments. He has broad experience developing with cloud services such as Amazon EC2, Google AppEngine, Heroku and VMware CloudFoundry. Eliran is also savvy with Spark, Presto, Flink and TensorFlow, but his main interests are in JVM languages, Golang, Docker and Kubernetes. Prior to iguazio, Eliran worked at global tech leading companies such as VMware and F5 Networks. He has a B.Sc in Math and Computer Science and an MBA from Bar Ilan University.

We created this series as an introduction to programming with Python.  Why Python? It's a very popular way to writing computer programs and automations with board applications: SpaceX & NASA use it to launch rockets, Tesla with autonomous driving, Instagram as a web app backend, Intel to pilot drones/UAVs, and many many others.  What you can do with Python is nearly endless:  Run powerful web applications Fly drones and launch rockets Run autonomous robots like drones and self-driving cars Build connected systems with Arduino and Raspberry PI Automate business intelligences and perform financial analysis Machine learning including deep learning And many more ways That list is fancy but don't let it scare you. Python is just a tool for writing a series of step-by-step automation rules and that's exactly what software is: a collection of rules for a computer to follow.  The right tools in the right hands can impact the world in such amazing ways.  Shakespeare had very few tools for writing plays and yet he continues to influence our entertainment despite being long gone. Creativity mixed with the right tools can transform how we do everything or why we do it.  That's why I want to teach you this tool. The world needs your creatively, your perspective, your project.

Developers can write a query written in their language of choice (Scala/Java/Python/R) using powerful high-level APIs (DataFrames / Datasets / SQL) and apply that same query to both static datasets and streaming data. In case of streaming, Spark will automatically create an incremental execution plan that automatically handles late, out-of-order data and ensures end-to-end exactly-once fault-tolerance guarantees.   In this practical session, I will walk through a concrete streaming ETL example where ‚Äì in less than 10 lines ‚Äì you can read raw, unstructured data from Kafka data, transform it and write it out as a structured table ready for batch and ad-hoc queries on up-to-the-last-minute data. I will give a quick glimpse of advanced features like event-time based aggregations, stream-stream joins and arbitrary stateful operations.  ABOUT THE SPEAKER:  Tathagata is a committer and PMC to the Apache Spark project and a Software Engineer at Databricks. He is the lead developer of Spark Streaming, and now focuses primarily on Structured Streaming. Previously, he was a member of the AMPLab, UC Berkeley as a graduate student researcher where he conducted research on data-center frameworks and networks with Scott Shenker and Ion Stoica.

In order to truly iterate and develop a codebase, one has to be able to confidently test during the development process and monitor the production system.   In this talk, I hope to address the key components for building out end to end testing for data pipelines by borrowing concepts from how we test python web services. Just like how we want to check for healthy status codes from our API responses, we want to be able to check that a pipeline is working as expected given the correct inputs. We‚Äôll talk about key features that allows a data pipeline to be easily testable and how to identify timeseries metrics that can be used to monitor the health of a data pipeline.

Building new global micro-services with real-time data processing gets complicated in such an environment. Therefore, we built a global data pipeline, called ‚ÄúData Fridge‚Äù which provides data normalization and data validation to downstream consumers.  Our data pipeline is fully serverless and provides three different ways to consume data (HTTP push, HTTP pull and SQL batch for big data processing).  In this session, I will cover in detail how we have built this data pipeline using several AWS and GCP services. I will describe why we chose these services and what are the challenges and limitations we have faced so far.  ABOUT THE SPEAKER  Vicente is currently leading the streaming data pipeline at Delivery Hero. After finishing his degree of Telecommunications Engineering, he moved to Berlin 9 years ago. During this time he has collected extensive experience as frontend, backend, devops and architect. Since 2018, his team has developed a service ingesting several million events per day which are consumed by 15+ teams in real-time within the company.

To truly expand and develop a code base, developers must be able to test confidently during the development process and monitor the production system. Monitoring and testing data pipelines or real-time streaming processes can be very different from monitoring web services. Jiaqi draws on her experience building and maintaining both batch and real-time stream data pipelines to discuss how to leverage monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to define and visualize metrics, how and when to alert on common health indicators, and how to gain visibility in monitoring not just the system health but the health of the data. General concepts she touches on include observability of pipeline health, interpretability of data results and building features into data pipelines that makes monitoring and testing just a little [...]  TIMECODES 00:00 Intro 00:56 Data Pipelines 03:20 What could go wrong? 05:16 Data pipeline concerns 06:14 Interpretability 07:42 Observability 08:44 Pipeline features 09:17 Immutable data 10:52 Data lineage 13:08 Dry run mode 15:21 Testing, monitoring & alerting  Download slides and read the full abstract here: https://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1321/observability-for-data-pipelines-monitoring-alerting-and-tracing-lineage  RECOMMENDED BOOKS Rishu Mehra ‚Ä¢ What is Data Observability ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3zdkxFK Gerardus Blokdyk ‚Ä¢ Observability Services A Complete Guide ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3zgA73A  https://twitter.com/GOTOchgo https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto- https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences #Prometheus #Grafana #Data #Programming #Backend #DevOps #Streams #Frontend  Looking for a unique learning experience?

603	Devoxx	Apache Kafka and KSQL in Action : Let‚Äôs Build a Streaming Data Pipeline! by Robin Moffatt	1	2019-05-16	UCCBVCTuk6uJrN3iFV_3vurg	28844	565	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Z8_O0wEIafw/maxresdefault.webp	1920	1080	Science & Technology	DevoxxUK|DevoxxUK2019	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBVCTuk6uJrN3iFV_3vurg	Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again! Apache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant streaming platform, providing low-latency pub-sub messaging coupled with native storage and stream processing capabilities. Integrating Kafka with RDBMS, NoSQL, and object stores is simple with Kafka Connect, which is part of Apache Kafka. KSQL is a SQL streaming engine for Apache Kafka, and makes it possible to build stream processing applications at scale, written using a familiar SQL interface.  In this talk we‚Äôll explain the architectural reasoning for Apache Kafka and the benefits of real-time integration, and we‚Äôll build a streaming data pipeline using nothing but our bare hands, Kafka Connect, and KSQL.  Gasp as we filter events in real time! Be amazed at how we can enrich streams of data with data from RDBMS! Be astonished at the power of streaming aggregates for anomaly detection!

They‚Äôre backing out; they‚Äôve had enough.¬†  But here‚Äôs what doesn't make sense.¬†  Rigorous studies by the Obama Administration in which Joe Biden served as vice president concluded that the pipeline would not create an environmental hazard.¬†The oil is coming out of the ground no matter what. It‚Äôs only a question of how it gets to where it needs to go.¬†¬†  The pipeline would have created thousands of construction jobs and moved large amounts of needed oil and gas from Canada to refineries in the US.¬†  Lots of upside; almost no downside.¬†  That‚Äôs why President Biden‚Äôs antipathy toward the project is hard to understand.¬†  Maybe it‚Äôs a safety issue? So, let‚Äôs look at pipelines from a safety perspective.¬†  Within the US, oil and gas have to be transported from point A to point B. To do this, oil producers have three choices: pipeline, rail, or road.  Fortunately, all three methods have low accident rates, but pipelines are clearly the safest.  Here‚Äôs why:  They don‚Äôt move.¬†  Trains move.¬†  Trucks move.¬†  Pipelines don‚Äôt.¬†  When oil is in a pipeline, the pipeline stays still and the oil moves with little risk of accident. New technology makes it even safer. Pipelines can now be monitored for a leak the size of a pinhole. Sophisticated pressure gauges can signal if oil pressure is declining, another sign of a potential problem.  Moving oil and gas safely around the continent is a big deal because the amount of oil and gas moved is a big deal.¬†  For example, the United States imports about 3.2 million barrels a day of crude oil from Canada alone. And, of course, it moves much more oil within its own borders.¬†  Petroleum production in the United States is about 11 million barrels a day.¬† U.S. natural gas production is about 100 billion cubic feet per day.¬†  No matter how many net-zero carbon mandates are passed, that won‚Äôt change.¬†  It all has to go somewhere. And most of it already goes through pipelines.¬†  America has 190,000 miles of onshore and offshore petroleum pipelines and 2.4 million miles of natural gas pipelines that collect natural gas and send it to businesses and consumers.¬†  Approximately 80 percent of crude oil and petroleum products are shipped by pipeline. Road and rail account for most of the rest with tanker and barge making up a small fraction.  If safety and environmental damages in the transportation of oil and gas were proportionate to the volume of shipments, the majority of harmful incidents should involve pipelines. But the opposite is true: the majority of incidents involve road and rail.  And when they do happen, they can be catastrophic. For example, in July of 2013, 47 people were killed when a train carrying oil derailed in the Canadian town of Lac-M√©gantic, Quebec. The entire town was leveled in the conflagration that ensued.¬†  Data on oil and gas transportation is available from the US Department of Transportation. The department keeps track of all injuries and fatalities.  Natural gas transmission lines had a low average injury rate for operator personnel and the general public, having an average of only 5 per year over the past ten years.  Just as natural gas transmission pipelines are connected with few injuries, they are also connected with few deaths. Between 2011 and 2020, there was an average of 2 deaths annually from natural gas transmission pipeline incidents.

I'm working on detecting one hell of a pattern: crypto currency prices. When I first started tinkering on this project I built something that used data on-demand from the Gemini Exchange API. Having invested more time into the project, I've realized that the best way to improve the whole system is to build a data pipeline that supports easy access to a rich history of cryptocurrency prices.  That's the core of this video: how is this data pipeline going to come together? What even is a data pipeline, within the context of this independent project to build a trading system?  Let's find out, and let's make this thing happen.

In this talk, we will outline the key considerations which need to be applied when building data pipelines, such as performance, idempotency, reproducibility, and tackling the small file problem. We'll work towards describing a common Data Engineering toolkit which separates these concerns from business logic code, allowing non-Data-Engineers (e.g. Business Analysts and Data Scientists) to define data pipelines without worrying about the nitty-gritty production considerations. We'll then introduce an implementation of such a toolkit in the form of Waimak, our open-source library for Apache Spark (https://github.com/CoxAutomotiveDataSolutions/waimak), which has massively shortened our route from prototype to production. Finally, we'll define new approaches and best practices about what we believe is the most overlooked aspect of Data Engineering: deploying data pipelines.

The lack of established ways to exchange and access data was a highly recognized contributing factor in our poor response to the pandemic. On multiple occasions we have witnessed how our poor practices around reproducibility and provenance have completely sidetracked major vaccine research efforts, prompting many calls for action from scientific and medical communities to address these problems.  Breaking down silos, reproducibility and provenance are all complex problems that will not disappear overnight ‚Äì solving them requires a continuous process of incremental improvements. Unfortunately, we believe that our workflows are not suited even for that. Modern data science encourages routine copying of data, with every transformation step producing data that is disjoint from its source. It‚Äôs hard to tell where most data comes from, how it was altered, and no practical way to verify that no malicious or accidental alterations were made. All of our common data workflows are in complete contradiction with the essential prerequisites for collaboration and trust, meaning that even when the results are shared they often cannot be easily reused.  This talk is the result of 2 years of R&D work in taking a completely different perspective on data pipeline design. We demonstrate what happens if the prerequisites for collaboration such as repeatability, verifiability, and provenance are chosen as core properties of the system. We present a new open standard for decentralized and trusted data transformation and exchange that leverages the latest advancements of modern data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Flink to create a truly global data pipeline.

First, we will review the tf.data library. Then, we will download a sample image and label files. After gathering all the image file paths in the directories, we will merge file names with lables to create the train and test datasets. Using tf.data.Dataset methods, we will learn how to map, prefetch, cache, and batch the datasets correctly so that the data input pipeline will be efficient in terms of time and performance. We will discuss how map, prefetch, cache, and batch functions affect the performance of the tf.data.Dataset input pipeline performance.  Moreover, we will see how to use TensorBoard add-on "TF Profiler" for monitoring the performance and bottlenecks of the tf.data input pipeline.  If you would like to learn more about Deep Learning with practical coding examples, please subscribe to my YouTube Channel or follow my blog on Medium. Do not forget to turn on Notifications so that you will be notified when new parts are uploaded.  You can access this Colab Notebook using the link given in the video description below.  Colab Notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dpojRslAA15q4tswH_9j8WIQRo0BITSp?usp=sharing  Now we can gather the image file names and paths by traversing the images/ folders. There are two options to load file list from image directory using tf.data.Dataset module as follows. Create the file list dataset by Dataset.from_tensor_slices() We can use Path and glob methods in pathlib module for browsing the image folder and compile all the image file names and paths. In most cases, we would like to test the input pipeline with a small portion of the data to ensure the performance and accuracy of the tf.data pipeline design.  Here, we select a very small set of images and observe the effects of map, prefect, cache, and batch methods. We can supply the image file list to tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices() for creating a dataset of file paths. Create the file list dataset by Dataset.list_files() As stated in the tf.data.Dataset documentation:  list_files(file_pattern, shuffle=None, seed=None) is used for creating a dataset of all files matching one or more glob patterns.  The file_pattern argument should be a small number of glob patterns.  If your filenames have already been globbed, use Dataset.from_tensor_slices(filenames) instead, as re-globbing every filename with list_files may result in poor performance with remote storage systems."  Since, we have already globbed the file names & paths above, we will not use the below approach.   In this method, we can not specify the number of selected samples. map(map_func) method Maps map_func across the elements of this dataset. As stated in the official documentation:  "To use Python code inside of the function you have a few options:  1) Rely on AutoGraph to convert Python code into an equivalent graph computation. The downside of this approach is that AutoGraph can convert some but not all Python code.  2) Use tf.py_function, which allows you to write arbitrary Python code but will generally result in worse performance than 1)."  Here, I use tf.py_function because, unfortunately, AutoGraph did not work on the combine_images_labels() funtion properly. Furthermore, as noted in the official documentation:  "Performance can often be improved by setting num_parallel_calls so that map will use multiple threads to process elements. If deterministic order isn't required, it can also improve performance to set deterministic=False."  Since reading files from hard disk takes much time, we apply these suggested methods.s discussed in Better performance with the tf.data API, there are several ways to increase the performance of input data pipelines in tf.data.  By increasing the performance of the input pipeline, we can decrease the overall train and test processing time.  The general strategy to overlap the input pipeline steps (reading file paths, uploading and processing image data, filtering lable info, converting them to image data and label tuples, etc.) with batch computation during train or test phase. Here, I summarize the most related methods very shortly:Prefetching: Prefetching overlaps the preprocessing and model execution of a training step. Caching: The tf.data.Dataset.cache transformation can cache a dataset, either in memory or on local storage. This will save some operations (like file opening and data reading) from being executed during each epoch. Batching: Combines consecutive elements of this dataset into batches. The exact order of these transformation depends on several factor. For more details please refer to Better performance with the tf.data API

Think again! Apache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant streaming platform, providing low-latency pub-sub messaging coupled with native storage and stream processing capabilities. Integrating Kafka with RDBMS, NoSQL, and object stores is simple with Kafka Connect, which is part of Apache Kafka. KSQL is the open-source SQL streaming engine for Apache Kafka, and makes it possible to build stream processing applications at scale, written using a familiar SQL interface.  In this talk we‚Äôll explain the architectural reasoning for Apache Kafka and the benefits of real-time integration, and we‚Äôll build a streaming data pipeline using nothing but our bare hands, Kafka Connect, and KSQL.  Gasp as we filter events in real time! Be amazed at how we can enrich streams of data with data from RDBMS! Be astonished at the power of streaming aggregates for anomaly detection!  Robin Moffatt  From Confluent Robin is a Developer Advocate at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle ACE Director and Developer Champion. His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. His particular interests are analytics, systems architecture, performance testing and optimization. He blogs at http://cnfl.io/rmoff and http://rmoff.net/ (and previously http://ritt.md/rmoff) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff. Outside of work he enjoys drinking good beer and eating fried breakfasts, although generally not at the same time.

Domain Randomization varies the parameters that define a scene in the simulation environment. Some of the parameters include the pose, scale of various objects in a scene, the lighting of the simulated environment, the appearance of simulated objects via their color and texture properties and so on. One of the main objectives of domain randomization is to enhance the training of deep learning applications by exposing the neural network to wide variety of domain parameters in simulation which will help to generalize well to real world applications. For additional information, also refer to the documentation below: https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/ext_omni_isaac_dr.html  NVIDIA Omniverse‚Ñ¢ is an open platform built for virtual collaboration and real-time photorealistic simulation.

666	Hasgeek TV	7 steps to build-your-own data pipeline - for day 1 of your startup	0	2019-07-27	hasgeek	1336	22	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/V1zuOaX7PRk/maxresdefault.webp	1920	1080	Science & Technology	The|hasgeek|Fifth|Elephant	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDHao9FxNRHw1VyLuGXI_rA	We are a gaming company making mass market social games. Since being in a consumer market where user experience is the the key, we had to rely heavily on data from Day 1 of game/product launches. This is the reason we actually built our data infrastructure in parallel to games/products and had it ready for production usage from begining itself. We relied heavily on ready-to-use systems but at the same time had to be cost sensitive being a startup. Setting up whole data-lake and heavy duty hdfs cluster was ruled out due to cost and maintenance overhead. We setup a lightweight data collection pipline to central queues which is then ingested in realtime to our warehouse of choice Redshift (reason being ease-of-use). Also, scaling such a system has its cost overheads when your product grows. So we had to design data retention and data querying capabilities such that we aren‚Äôt paying hefty bills as well as aren‚Äôt being limited in terms of querying real-time data from our users.  I am Kumar Puspesh, CTO and Co-Founder of Moonfrog, India‚Äôs top mobile gaming company. We had to design a large scale data infrastructre from day 1 of our company to cater to our product needs. Having a cost sensitive as well as scalable approach helped us achieve large scale as a gaming company in India in short amount of time. At the same time taught us a lot of ingenious ways of building large scale infra customized for business and its users (rather than a generic paid solution and then changing your usage/requirements based on that).

681	Databricks	Designing ETL Pipelines with Structured Streaming and Delta Lake‚Äî How to Architect Things Right	0	2019-10-21	UC3q8O3Bh2Le8Rj1-Q-_UUbA	22160	387	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eOhAzjf__iQ/maxresdefault.webp	1280	720	Science & Technology	#SparkAISummit	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3q8O3Bh2Le8Rj1-Q-_UUbA	Structured Streaming has proven to be the best platform for building distributed stream processing applications. Its unified SQL/Dataset/DataFrame APIs and Spark's built-in functions make it easy for developers to express complex computations. Delta Lake, on the other hand, is the best way to store structured data because it is a open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads Together, these can make it very easy to build pipelines in many common scenarios. However, expressing the business logic is only part of the larger problem of building end-to-end streaming pipelines that interact with a complex ecosystem of storage systems and workloads. It is important for the developer to truly understand the business problem that needs to be solved. Apache Spark, being a unified analytics engine doing both batch and stream processing, often provides multiples ways to solve the same problem. So understanding the requirements carefully helps you to architect your pipeline that solves your business needs in the most resource efficient manner. In this talk, I am going examine a number common streaming design patterns in the context of the following questions. WHAT are you trying to consume? What are you trying to produce? What is the final output that the business wants? What are your throughput and latency requirements? WHY do you really have those requirements? Would solving the requirements of the individual pipeline actually solve your end-to-end business requirements? HOW are going to architect the solution? And how much are you willing to pay for it Clarity in understanding the 'what and why' of any problem can automatically much clarity on the 'how' to architect it using Structured Streaming and, in many cases, Delta Lake.

For a large part, the proper configuration of a given data pipeline is the result of the data scientist experience and Subject Matter Expert knowledge, plus a dose of arbitrary decisions. What if most of this work could be automated? Better, is it possible to find some universal pipeline configurations that can work well on a wide range of domains and thus transfer what has been learn on one dataset to another? In this presentation, we show on a PoC that Sequential Model-Based Optimization techniques can be used to tune data pipeline hyperparameters in order to improve model accuracy. We discuss how to measure if optimal configurations are algorithm-specific or independent, shows that, in the specific case of NLP preprocessing operators, there might exist some kind of generally good configurations, independently of the algorithm or the data. === www.pydata.org  PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.

In this lab you will learn some more advanced Dataprep techniques.  Use Case Scenario: Google Patents Public Data, provided by IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, is a worldwide bibliographic and US full-text dataset of patent publications. Patent information accessibility is critical for examining new patents, informing public policy decisions, managing corporate investment in intellectual property, and promoting future scientific innovation.  When new patent applications are reviewed, researchers often build on previous publications and cite them in their works. In this lab, you will examine how Dataprep can be used on complicated data structures in BigQuery. Using the data, you will build out a leaderboard for inventors who were most frequently cited for a particular month of patents publications.  Objectives In this lab, you will learn how to: - Import data from BigQuery to Dataprep - Create datasets from custom SQL - Create objects and nested data structures - Override parameters when running jobs  #qwiklabs #gcp #googlecloud

Apache Kafka is a publish-subscribe messaging system rethought of as a distributed commit log. Kafka is designed to allow a single cluster to serve as the central data backbone. A single Kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads and writes per second from thousands of clients. It can be elastically and transparently expanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned and spread over a cluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the capability of any single machine and to allow clusters of coordinated consumers. Messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent data loss. Each broker can handle terabytes of messages. For the Spring user, Spring Integration Kafka and Spring XD provide integration with Apache Kafka.

SNCF (French National Railway Company) has distributed a network of beacons over its 32,000 km of train tracks, triggering a flow of events at each train passage. In this talk, we will present how we built a real-time data processing on these data, to monitor traffic and map the propagation of train delays.  During the presentation we will demonstrate how to build an end to end solution, from ingestion to exposure.  The presentation will take place as follows: -Data Pipeline: how we set up a data transformation pipeline using Spark 3 and Delta with Azure Databricks and how Delta Lake makes dynamically updated data reliable -Exposure: how we expose our output in the best way depending on the consumer Power BI or REST API. -Production-ready: finally, we will demonstrate how we have structured our development process to make it reliable and aligned with SNCF best practices.

Making the best use of all specialized services has historically required custom, error-prone data transformation and transport. Now, users can use the AWS Data Pipeline service to orchestrate data flows between Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, and on-premise data stores, seamlessly and efficiently applying EC2 instances and EMR clusters to process and transform data. In this session, we demonstrate how you can use AWS Data Pipeline to coordinate your Big Data workflows, applying the optimal data storage technology to each part of your data integration architecture.   Swipely's Head of Engineering shows how Swipely uses AWS Data Pipeline to build batch analytics, backfilling all their data, while using resources efficiently. Consequently, Swipely launches novel product features with less development time and less operational complexity.

Combining Python with Apache Flink, particularly for Machine Learning, has its complications, but can also produce an incredibly fast, portable, scalable, and highly flexible data pipeline.  This talk covers the structure and technical features of a Python-Flink pipeline. It also goes over getting started, and more importantly - addressing the common mistakes and hurdles of building one. This includes which features to use and how to leverage the strengths of each framework based on your specific use case. For instance, when would you use regular Python, and when would you want to use PyFlink? Are there cases where you would NOT want to use some of the abstraction or automation tools available for these frameworks?  Attendees will get out of this talk an introduction to working with Apache Flink with Python, and pragmatic tips and tricks for a smoother, faster, more enjoyable (because this should be fun!) dive into this symbiotic relationship.  This talk is geared towards those who are new to Flink but is applicable to anyone with beginner to advanced Python experience.  https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2021/talk/V8JNGK/  After three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.  PyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community.

What is AWS Datapipeline ? AWS Datapipeline is a webservice that helps to process and move data between different AWS compute and storage  services at specific intervals.  AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that supports the reliable processing and moving of data between AWS data processing and storage services and local data sources at specified intervals. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can periodically access, scalably transform and process your data (regardless of its location), and efficiently translate results into AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EMR.  Using AWS Data Pipeline, you can effortlessly create complex data processing loads that are fault-tolerant, repeatable, and highly available. You do not have to worry about ensuring availability of resources, managing dependencies between tasks, not repeating tasks that are suspended due to errors or timeouts, and not developing an error notification system. AWS Data Pipeline also allows you to move and process data that was previously isolated in local data silos.  What is AWS Data Pipeline? AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that enables you to automate the moving and transforming of data. You can use AWS Data Pipeline to create data-driven workflows that allow certain tasks to run only when the previous tasks complete successfully. You only need to set the desired parameters for the data transformations. AWS Data Pipeline then implements the configured logic.  The following components of AWS Data Pipeline are involved in managing the data:  A pipeline definition defines the business logic of data management. For more information, see Syntax of the Pipeline Definition File .  With a pipeline tasks are planned and executed by Amazon EC2 instances are created for defined activities. You just need to upload the pipeline definition to the pipeline and then enable it. You can also edit the pipeline definition of a currently running pipeline. You will only need to reactivate the pipeline for the changes to take effect. You can also disable the pipeline, change a data source, and then re-enable the pipeline. If you no longer need the pipeline, you can delete it.  Task Runner queries for tasks and performs these tasks. For example, Task Runner can copy log files to Amazon S3 and start Amazon EMR clusters. Task Runner is automatically installed and run on the resources created by your pipeline definitions. You can create your own Task Runner application or use the Task Runner application provided by AWS Data Pipeline. For more information, see Task Runner .  For example, you can use AWS Data Pipeline to archive your web server's logs daily to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and then run an Amazon EMR (Amazon EMR) cluster weekly through these logs to generate traffic reports. In this case, AWS Data Pipeline schedules the day-to-day tasks of copying the data and the weekly task of starting the Amazon EMR cluster. AWS Data Pipeline also ensures that Amazon EMR is waiting to analyze until the last day's data has been uploaded to Amazon S3, even if there are unforeseen delays in uploading.

Whether to provide recommendations for users, getting insights on how they use the product, or using machine learning to improve the experience. This creates a critical need for reliable data operations and understanding how data is flowing through our systems. Data pipelines must be auditable, reliable, and run on time. This proves particularly difficult in a constantly changing, fast-paced environment.  Collecting this lineage metadata as data pipelines are running provides an understanding of dependencies between many teams consuming and producing data and how constant changes impact them. It is the underlying foundation that enables the many use cases related to data operations. The OpenLineage project is an API standardizing this metadata across the ecosystem, reducing complexity and duplicate work in collecting lineage information. It enables many projects, consumers of lineage in the ecosystem whether they focus on operations, governance or security.  Marquez is an open source project part of the LF AI & Data foundation which instruments data pipelines to collect lineage and metadata and enable those use cases. It implements the OpenLineage API and provides context by making visible dependencies across organizations and technologies as they change over time.

This service makes it easy for you to design extract-transform-load (ETL) activities using structured and unstructured data, both on-premises and in the cloud, based on your business logic.  To use AWS Data Pipeline, you create a pipeline definition that specifies the business logic for your data processing. A typical pipeline definition consists of activities that define the work to perform, data nodes that define the location and type of input and output data, and a schedule that determines when the activities are performed.  In this tutorial, you run a shell command script that counts the number of GET requests in Apache web server logs. This pipeline runs every 15 minutes for an hour, and writes output to Amazon S3 on each iteration.  Prerequisites  Before you begin, complete the tasks in Setting up for AWS Data Pipeline.  Pipeline Objects  The pipeline uses the following objects:  ShellCommandActivity Reads the input log file and counts the number of errors.  S3DataNode (input) The S3 bucket that contains the input log file.  S3DataNode (output) The S3 bucket for the output.  Ec2Resource The compute resource that AWS Data Pipeline uses to perform the activity.  Note that if you have a large amount of log file data, you can configure your pipeline to use an EMR cluster to process the files instead of an EC2 instance.  Schedule Defines that the activity is performed every 15 minutes for an hour.  Tasks  Create the Pipeline Monitor the Running Pipeline View the Output Delete the Pipeline Create the Pipeline The quickest way to get started with AWS Data Pipeline is to use a pipeline definition called a template.  To create the pipeline  Open the AWS Data Pipeline console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/.  From the navigation bar, select a region. You can select any region that's available to you, regardless of your location. Many AWS resources are specific to a region, but AWS Data Pipeline enables you to use resources that are in a different region than the pipeline.  The first screen that you see depends on whether you've created a pipeline in the current region.  If you haven't created a pipeline in this region, the console displays an introductory screen. Choose Get started now.  If you've already created a pipeline in this region, the console displays a page that lists your pipelines for the region. Choose Create new pipeline.  In Name, enter a name for your pipeline.  (Optional) In Description, enter a description for your pipeline.  For Source, select Build using a template, and then select the following template: Getting Started using ShellCommandActivity.  Under the Parameters section, which opened when you selected the template, leave S3 input folder and Shell command to run with their default values. Click the folder icon next to S3 output folder, select one of your buckets or folders, and then click Select.  Under Schedule, leave the default values. When you activate the pipeline the pipeline runs start, and then continue every 15 minutes for an hour.  If you prefer, you can select Run once on pipeline activation instead.  Under Pipeline Configuration, leave logging enabled. Choose the folder icon under S3 location for logs, select one of your buckets or folders, and then choose Select.  If you prefer, you can disable logging instead.  Under Security/Access, leave IAM roles set to Default.  Click Activate.  If you prefer, you can choose Edit in Architect to modify this pipeline. For example, you can add preconditions.

The speaker will highlight the main concepts used to build the data pipeline and run a simple demo to illustrate these concepts.  Abstract Overview: This talk will introduce the use of Python and several related modules (GDAL, Shapely, Fiona etc) to build a GIS-based data processing pipeline to retrieve the road network information required to build a rural-urban classification scheme for a region of interest. The speaker will highlight the main concepts used to build the data pipeline and run a simple demo to illustrate these concepts.  Background: A promising source of information for rural-urban classification alternative to population census is remote sensing data, particularly multispectral satellite imagery. A rural-urban classifier based on remote sensing data has the advantage of data consistency and data timeliness. However, from a cost perspective, the proposed methodology has limited practical applicability. The main drawback is that, for geographically diverse countries, the yearly acquisition cost of multispectral satellite images from satellite data provider is prohibitively expensive. Another drawback is that the quality of the satellite images is heavily dependent on the imaging conditions.  In the presence of adverse imaging conditions such as extensive cloud coverage, satellite images of a region may become unclear or unavailable for classification. Even when satellite images are readily available, pre-classification image processing is still necessary and onerous to execute, as the existing classification methodology is sensitive to variations in tone and color of the acquired satellite images.  To address these limitations, a novel solution to the rural-urban classification problem is crafted using data features extracted from road network information. Primarily, rural and urban areas are characterized by distinctive road network profiles. Rural areas generally feature long stretches of road with few intersections and branchings, whereas in urban areas the road networks are often highly inter-connected, resulting in short road segments and a large number of intersections.

766	Apache Beam	Creating a Stream Data Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform using Apache Beam	0	2020-01-12	UChNnb_YO_7B0HlW6FhAXZZQ	1404	6	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PEf58tvl93s/maxresdefault.webp	1920	1080	Science & Technology		https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChNnb_YO_7B0HlW6FhAXZZQ	We built a scalable and flexible stream data pipeline for our microservices on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Cloud Dataflow, using Apache Beam. The stream data pipeline is working on the production system for Mercari, one of the biggest C2C e-commerce services in Japan. The pipeline currently accepts logs from 5+ microservices, and the number will increase soon.  Our microservice architecture is based on the following three concepts: 1. Split the log collection and data processing phases to keep the system simple. 2. Use stream processing in order to achieve low latency. 3. Don‚Äôt just accumulate raw data‚Äîsupport structured output that is easier to use.  Based on these concepts, we built a data pipeline in GCP, as seen below: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3qx5hq0438aqv35/StreamDataPipelineV2.jpg  For each microservice, we will provide a Cloud Pub/Sub ‚ÄúRamp‚Äù to send logs to. Cloud Pub/Sub can have messages that contain an optional byte array in their payloads. The entire message that is ingested into the Ramp uses Cloud Dataflow streaming processing to collect them in the ‚ÄúRawDataHub,‚Äù a Cloud Pub/Sub topic for collection. When this happens, the PubsubMessage payload is not changed at all; the metadata necessary for subsequent processing (destination and schema information, data necessary for pipeline metrics, etc.) is provided in the PubsubMessage‚Äôs attribute map. This Dataflow job does not do processing for each service or topic‚Äîit treats all messages uniformly.The raw data from RawDataHub is then output to two independent Cloud DataFlow streaming processes: ‚ÄúRawDataLake‚Äù(the infrastructure is in Google Cloud Storage, or ‚ÄúGCS‚Äù) and ‚ÄúStructuredDataHub‚Äù, another Cloud Pub/Sub topic. The StructuredDataHub has structured avro records. The structured data from StructuredDataHub is then sent to more two independent Cloud DataFlow streaming processes: ‚ÄúStructuredDataLake‚Äù on GCS and ‚ÄúData WareHouse‚Äù (Google BigQuery). --- The Beam Summit North America 2019 was a 2-day event held in Las Vegas, all focused around Apache Beam.

In this series, we have been covering all the topics related to Text Generation with sample implementations in Python. In this tutorial, we will focus on how to build an Efficient TensorFlow Input Pipeline for Word-Level Text Generation. First, we will download a sample corpus (text file). After opening the file and reading it line-by-line, we will split the text into words. Then, we will generate pairs including an input word sequence (X) and an output word (y). Using tf.data API and Keras TextVectorization methods, we will preprocess the text, convert the words into integer representation, prepare the training dataset from the pairs, optimize the data pipeline. Thus, in the end, we will be ready to train a Language Model for word-level text generation.

A Language Model can be trained to generate text word-by-word. In this case, each of the input and output tokens is made of word tokens. In training, we supply a sequence of words as input (X) and a target word (next word to complete the input) as output (y) After training, the Language Model learns to generate a conditional probability distribution over the vocabulary of words according to the given input sequence. Image for post To generate text, we can iterate over the below steps: Step 1: we provide a sequence of words to the Language Model as input Step 2: the Language Model outputs a conditional probability distribution over the vocabulary Step 3: we sample a word from the distribution Step 4: we concatenate the newly sampled word to the generated text Step 4: a new input sequence is generated by appending the newly sampled word For more details, please check Part A and B. Image for post Tensorflow Data Pipeline: tf.data What is a Data Pipeline? Data Pipeline is an automated process that involves extracting, transforming, combining, validating, and loading data for further analysis and visualization. It provides end-to-end velocity by eliminating errors and combatting bottlenecks or latency. It can process multiple data streams at once. In short, it is an absolute necessity for today‚Äôs data-driven solutions. If you are not familiar with data pipelines, you can check my tutorials in English or Turkish. Why Tensorflow Data Pipeline? The tf.data API enables us to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces. to handle large amounts of data, read from different data formats, and perform complex transformations. What can be done in a Text Data Pipeline? The pipeline for a text model might involve extracting symbols from raw text data, converting them to embedding identifiers with a lookup table, and batching together sequences of different lengths.

Enabling them to produce multiple consumable results for federal and public agencies. They did this in under 30 days, using Apache Kafka.  We built a similar (but simpler) demonstration streaming pipeline for ingesting, indexing, and visualizing some publicly available tidal data using multiple open source technologies including Apache Kafka, Apache Kafka Connect, Apache Camel Kafka Connector, Open Distro for Elasticsearch and Kibana, Prometheus, and Grafana.  In this talk, we introduce each technology, the pipeline architecture, and walk through the steps, challenges, and solutions to build an initial integration pipeline to ingest USA NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Tidal data, and add, map and index the data into Elasticsearch. With the goal to visualize the results with Kibana, where we‚Äôll see the period of the ‚ÄúLunar‚Äù day, and the size and location of tidal ranges. But what can go wrong? The initial pipeline worked reliably for a few days, but then unexpectedly failed when it encountered erroneous data. To make the pipeline more robust, we investigate Apache Kafka Connect exception handling and evaluate the benefits of using Apache Camel Kafka Connectors and Elasticsearch schema validation.  With a sufficiently robust pipeline in place, it‚Äôs time to scale it up. The first step is to select and monitor the most relevant metrics, across multiple technologies. We configured Prometheus to collect the metrics, and Kibana to produce a dashboard. With the monitoring in place, we were able to systematically increase the pipeline throughput by increasing Kafka connector tasks, while watching out for potential bottlenecks. We discovered and fixed, two bottlenecks in the pipeline, proving the value of this approach to pipeline scaling.  We conclude the presentation with lessons learned and some potential future challenges.

Reference Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DxlxptP7OQ4PqxSe-gLkjRu5xSnFzued/view  AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premises data sources, at specified intervals. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly access your data where it‚Äôs stored, transform and process it at scale, and efficiently transfer the results to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EMR.  AWS Data Pipeline helps you easily create complex data processing workloads that are fault tolerant, repeatable, and highly available. You don‚Äôt have to worry about ensuring resource availability, managing inter-task dependencies, retrying transient failures or timeouts in individual tasks, or creating a failure notification system. AWS Data Pipeline also allows you to move and process data that was previously locked up in on-premises data silos.  #AWSDataPipeline #MySQL #S3

Data Scientists do the expert analysis using SQL requests to the data warehouse; later a Data Engineer transforms that into a fast, consistent and robust data pipeline written in code such as Java, Scala or Python. But what if we could use the SQL for both the one-off analysis and for the streaming data pipeline? Apache Flink can help us achieve exactly this goal. Writing SQL for streaming applications does come with some additional considerations, and we will cover those in this session. We will also explore some examples of complex SQL tasks and how they could be refactored to be used in Flink. This session is recommended for anyone who wants to build and maintain robust data pipelines.

Using the value provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) for data storage, AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) for task queuing, and FME Cloud for data processing infrastructure, Tesera has developed an asynchronous data pipeline that manages client data from upload through to model indicator development for a number of analysis applications. Additionally, the FME Cloud Scheduler is used to reduce infrastructure costs having the data processing engine available only during business hours, and SQS to house the task in queue until the processing engine is online.    The entire pipeline includes:  1. user project creation via web application - SQS queue to initiate base project data  2. user data upload via web application - data storage to S3 - SQS queue of data to be checked - FME Cloud to perform data checking - S3 to store results of data checking  3. user views results of data checking via web application - SQS queue of valid data to be processed - FME Cloud to process raw data into model indicators - S3 to store processed project data  4. user views project data via web application and kicks off data analysis    My presentation will walk users through the entire pipeline focusing on how we have setup FME Cloud to watch for and process new SQS queue messages, how we generically manage data locally on FME Cloud, and how we get to use S3 as the primary data repository.

801	NixCon	Georges Dubus - Nix for data pipeline configuration (NixCon 2018)	0	2018-10-27	UCjqkNrQ8F3OhKSCfCgagWLg	504	12	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/tc5ApNqhAQ4/maxresdefault.webp	1920	1080	Science & Technology	NixOS|NixCon2018	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqkNrQ8F3OhKSCfCgagWLg	My team develops a data pipeline to generate music recommendations. It consists of many batch jobs that read data from somewhere and write their output somewhere else, with complex dependencies and parameter tuning. Historically, we have configured these batch jobs with hand-written bash configuration, or with dedicated python-based tools such as Airflow. However, both lack flexibility, often forcing the developer to bypass them and to run jobs manually during development. The tasks of data pipeline configuration and package definition share some requirements: both imply running many programs in a specific order and with specific parameters. Since nix is a language dedicated to packages definition, which allows expressing packages in a succinct and highly flexible way, we decided to try to use it for data pipeline configuration. Nix-the-tool is too centered around package management for our use case, so we built our own tool around nix-the-language. It this talk, we‚Äôll explore how to apply nix to data pipeline configuration. This will give us the opportunity to look at nix as a language, abstracted from its current ecosystem. We‚Äôll also explore how to structure a nix codebase, encountering the same questions nixpkgs encountered a long time ago, but in a much smaller environment. The main goal of this talk is to share the different point of view of nix that comes from applying it to a different problem and starting from scratch. We also hope to serve as an inspiration to explore other nix-based DSLs. --- Bio: Georges is a Software Engineer at SoundCloud, in Berlin. He is part of the team that generates music recommendations. He loves exploring new ways to solve engineering problems, which led him to look into exciting technologies such as Haskell and NixOS. He contributed a few tools to the nix community, such as http://howoldis.herokuapp.com/ and the infamous Travis Nixpkgs integration. Some of his favorites hobbies are playing board games and learning German.  Slides: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4r1oNPr9K9LWUtlMWdBenRhbGxEbWtvVmNRUGMyaWFkcmZF

Its Python infrastructure reconciles and cleans data to produce a unified view of history, repackages cleaned data into higher-performance formats, and produces analytics data that is provided to Quantopian‚Äôs worldwide community as a free portfolio risk model (usually only available to institutions).  But that high-level view of Quantopian‚Äôs business is an abstraction; as the company scaled its research and trading infrastructure, the engine keeping Quantopian running grew to almost a hundred cron jobs. These brittle scheduling systems regularly failed in the real world, where vendors are late, data is missing, and services fail. As the company considered adding support for global markets, it knew it needed to invest in a more resilient and flexible approach.  Quantopian began researching a data pipeline solution in late 2017 and rapidly converged on Apache Airflow as the right tool for the job. The team spent a month on research and prototyping and another month developing a detailed implementation plan to introduce Airflow to the rest of the company: adoption targets, documentation, code samples, and test suites.  Quantopian‚Äôs site reliability engineer James Meickle explains how in less than six months, Quantopian went from not knowing how it would ever escape its cron jobs to putting Airflow on the critical path for its high-reliability trading infrastructure. And the best news? Since Quantopian has done the research for you, you can do it even faster.  To learn more about Quantopian, visit http://www.quantopian.com.

At Indix we have data in different formats - html pages, thrift records, avro records and the usual culprits - CSVs and other plain text formats. We have data in TBs and in a few KBs and data consisting of billions of records and data consisting of a few hundred rows. And all this data - in one form or another - is consumed by the engineers, the product managers, the customer success team and even our CEO. Our biggest challenge was in knowing which data exists and where, and how to access it efficiently while balancing costs and productivity of the people involved. We had to make do with adhoc Scalding jobs. There was no single place where people can discover the different 'datasets' that we had, what format they were in, where they were stored and how frequently a new version was published. Running jobs was also not straightforward since things like finding a cluster to use were not trivial. In order to democratize the access to data and make it easy for anyone within the organization to work and play with the data we had, we went about building a data pipeline platform for our internal users. Leveraging the power of Spark, the platform allows the users to define datasets (along with their schema) and create pipelines to work with the datasets. The pipelines can be configured via a wizard based UI or a JSON config and all the jobs run on dedicated and auto scaled Spark clusters. Predefined transformations to filter, project, sample and even type in sql queries have made it powerful but simple to use for any type of user. Support for S3, Sftp and even Google sheets made it usable for different internal and customer use cases. The platform also enables us to load the same data and perform similar operations on them via notebooks with just couple of lines of client code. Today we run over 300 pipelines across over 100 datasets and thousands of versions of the datasets using this platform. The data pipeline platform has truly changed the way we ingest, manipulate, analyze and egress data across the organization, and is on course to be converted into a self-serve platform for our (external) customers too.

Data scientists want rapid iteration, infrastructure engineers want monitoring and security controls, and product owners want their solutions deployed in time for quarterly reports. Collaboration between these stakeholders can be difficult, as every data science pipeline has a unique set of constraints and system requirements (compute resources, network connectivity, etc). For these reasons, data engineers strive to give their data scientists as much flexibility as possible, while maintaining an observable and resilient infrastructure. In recent years, Apache Airflow (a Python-based task orchestrator developed at Airbnb) has gained popularity as a collaborative platform between data scientists and infrastructure engineers looking to spare their users from verbose and rigid YAML files. Apache Airflow exposes a flexible pythonic interface that can be used as a collaboration point between data engineers and data scientists. Data engineers can build custom operators that abstract details of the underlying system and data scientists can use those operators (and many more) to build a diverse range of data pipelines. For this talk, we will take an idea from a single-machine notebook to a cross-service Spark + Tensorflow pipeline, to a canary tested, hyper-parameter-tuned, production-ready model served on Google Cloud Functions. We will show how Apache Airflow can connect all layers of a data team to deliver rapid results.

Unlike software projects, after they were successfully delivered and deployed, they cannot be abandoned but must be continuously monitored if model performance still satisfies all requirements. We can always get new data with new statistical characteristics that can break our pipelines or influence model performance.  All these qualities of data & ML projects lead us to the necessity of continuous testing and monitoring of our models and pipelines. In this talk we will show how CI/CD Templates can simplify these tasks: bootstrap new data project within a minute, set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, implement integration tests on Databricks. All this is possible because of conventions introduced by CI/CD Templates which helps automate deployments & testing of abstract data pipelines and ML models.  The CI/CD templates are used by Runtastic for automating deployment processes of their Databricks pipelines. During this webinar Emanuele Viglianisi, Data Engineer at Runtastic will show how Runtasic is using CI/CD templates during their day to day development to run, test and deploy their pipelines directly from PyCharm IDE to Databricks. Emanuele will present the challenges Runtastic has faced and how they successfully solved them by integrating the CI/CD template in their workflow.

While an ad hoc workflow is great for exploratory analysis and winning Kaggle competitions, it‚Äôs a poor fit for the needs of production machine learning. The cliche that data scientists spend 80 percent of their time finding, cleaning, and reorganizing data is at least partially due to bad habits and a lack of modern data pipelines.  In this talk, we‚Äôll discuss the modern data pipeline as a continuously improving process flow that encompasses data ingest, data transformation, model training and deployment. In this vision, data scientists work with data engineers to create and evolve data pipelines and create shared data assets. Data cleaning, delivery and transformation is collaborative and automated so data scientists can spend more time identifying new opportunities and delivering value to customers and the business.

One year later, Yelp is running hundreds of streaming Flink jobs. These provide everything from simple data transformation, to complex stateful stream join and stream SQL queries. In this talk, I‚Äôll introduce the challenges that the Yelp data pipeline was facing and how Flink tackled them. I‚Äôll then focus on the integration of Apache Flink into an existing multi-regional Kafka based streaming ecosystem at scale. I‚Äôll discuss the challenges that we encountered during our journey and some of the best practices we learned while building and scaling the infrastructure for Flink.  https://data-artisans.com/

Its arrival coincides with the evolution of networked manufacturing systems driven by IoT. In this presentation we‚Äôll examine the rise of IoT and ML from a practitioners perspective to better understand how applications of AI can be built in industrial settings. We'll walk through a case study that combines multiple IoT and ML technologies to monitor and optimize an industrial heating and cooling HVAC system. Through this instructive example you'll see how the following components can be put into action: 1. A StreamSets data pipeline that sources from MQTT and persists to OpenTSDB 2. A TensorFlow model that predicts anomalies in streaming sensor data 3. A Spark application that derives new event streams for real-time alerts 4. A Grafana dashboard that displays factory sensors and alerts in an interactive view  By walking through this solution step-by-step, you'll learn how to build the fundamental capabilities needed in order to handle endless streams of IoT data and derive ML insights from that data: 1. How to transport IoT data through scalable publish/subscribe event streams 2. How to process data streams with transformations and filters 3. How to persist data streams with the timeliness required for interactive dashboards 4. How to collect labeled datasets for training machine learning models  At the end of this presentation you will have learned how a variety of tools can be used together to build ML enhanced applications and data products for instrumented manufacturing systems.

They did this in under 30 days, using #Apache Kafka.  Comment üí¨, Share üîó, Like üëç, and Subscribe ‚úÖ to our channel üì∫, and turn on the üîî to be alerted to new videos about #OpenSource #Databases... and many other things! https://percona.tv/subscribe  We built a similar (but simpler) demonstration pipeline for ingesting, indexing, and visualizing some publicly available tidal data using multiple open source technologies including #Apache Kafka, Apache Kafka Connect, Apache Camel Kafka Connectors, Open Distro for #Elasticsearch and Kibana, Prometheus and #Grafana.  In this talk, we introduce each technology, the pipeline architecture, and walk through the steps, challenges and solutions to build an initial integration pipeline to consume USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Tidal data, map and index the data types in Elasticsearch, and add missing data with an ingest pipeline. The goal being to visualize the results with Kibana, where we‚Äôll see the period of the ‚ÄúLunar‚Äù day, and the size and location of some small and large tidal ranges.  But what can go wrong? The initial pipeline only worked briefly, failing when it encountered exceptions. To make the pipeline more robust, we investigated Apache Kafka Connect exception handling, and evaluated the benefits of using Apache Camel Kafka Connectors, and Elasticsearch schema validation.  With a sufficiently robust pipeline in place, it‚Äôs time to scale it up. The first step is to select and monitor the most relevant metrics, across multiple technologies. We configured Prometheus to collect the metrics, and Kibana to produce a dashboard. With the monitoring in place we were able to systematically increase the pipeline throughput by increasing Kafka connector tasks, while watching out for potential bottlenecks. We discovered, and fixed, two bottlenecks in the pipeline, proving the value of this approach to pipeline scaling.  We conclude the presentation with lessons learned so far, and some potential future challenges.

Snowflake integration was taken very seriously in Lyftron, in order to overcome the limitations of traditional ETL/ELT tools that stage flat files on a local disk before pushing it to Snowflake. Such solution requires extra disk space for data loading and adds additional delays to the data pipeline.   Lyftron takes a unique approach to data loading into the Snowflake Data Warehouse by utilizing the new data streaming API available in Snowflake. Data is loaded from the data source, data transformations are applied on the fly as SQL expressions and the transformed data is streamed directly to Snowflake. The data is loaded without any delays and without the need to manage any space for temporary files. Additionally, Lyftron may push down selected SQL transformation directly to data sources to reduce the amount of data that must be transferred.  Snowflake customers can dramatically simplify and shorten their time to insight by utilizing Lyftron‚Äôs native Snowflake migration and modernization solutions . Just log into Lyftron, select any data to transfer to Snowflake and just schedule the pipeline. Setup should only take a few minutes and you can use Lyftron no obligation 1 month free trial.

The requirements were to process tens of terabytes of data coming from several sources with data refresh cadences varying from daily to annual. The main challenge is that each provider has their own quirks in schemas and delivery processes. To achieve this we use Apache Airflow to organize the workflows and to schedule their execution, including developing custom Airflow hooks and operators to handle similar tasks in different pipelines. We are running on AWS using Apache Spark to horizontally scale the data processing and Kubernetes for container management.  We will explain the reasons for this architecture, and we will also share the pros and cons we have observed when working with these technologies. Furthermore, we will explain how this approach has simplified the process of bringing in new data sources and considerably reduced the maintenance and operation overhead, but also the challenges that we have had during this transition.  ABOUT THE SPEAKERS:  Dr. Johannes Lepp√§ is a Data Engineer building scalable solutions for ingesting complex data sets at Komodo Health. Johannes is interested in the design of distributed systems and intricacies in the interactions between different technologies. He claims not to be lazy, but gets most excited about automating his work. Prior to data engineering he conducted research in the field of aerosol physics at the California Institute of Technology, and holds a PhD in physics from the University of Helsinki. Johannes is passionate about metal: wielding it, forging it and, especially, listening to it.

Come to this session for an overview of how we built a serverless pipeline to pull in data and serve as the backend behind the stackoverflow dashboard I built for my team of Developer Evangelists.  With data coming in from an external API plus updates to the data after it has arrived, there were some design decisions to make.  I'll share those decisions and talk about the ones we've iterated on and might alter in the future.  This talk is suitable for developers of all technical stacks.

Specifically we are gathering operations metrics with Jannah.io.  For example, we are pulling CICD metrics from Jenkins Builds.     We want to trend metrics like how many code repositories and branches are running builds on a day-to-day basis.  Which unit test cases are passing or failing. In addition, we are adding SEO from Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel.     As the Jannah Bots are collecting all these data, we ingest them using Tensorflow's TFX Machine Learning Production Pipeline. We will use tf.Records and tf.Example formats to feed the metrics into the TFX production pipeline.      Part of the Pipeline is the creating and training various machine learning models based on various transformations of the data.     Successfully trained models will be deployed for various application use cases.  Google analytics data, as well as data from Facebook Pixel can be used to predict or promote user behavior.  CICD metrics can be use to identify problem areas within code repositories.  Many use cases to be identified.

In general, a data science pipeline starts with the acquisition of raw data which is then manipulated through ETL processes and leads to a series of analytics.  Good data pipelines can be used to automate and schedule these steps, help with monitoring tasks, and even to dynamically train models. On top of that, they make the analyses easier to reproduce and productise.  In this workshop, you will learn how to migrate from ‚Äòscripts soups‚Äô (a set of scripts that should be run in a particular order) to robust, reproducible and easy-to-schedule data pipelines in Airflow. First, we will learn how to write simple recurrent ETL pipelines. We will then integrate logging and monitoring capabilities. And we will end using Airflow along with Jupyter Notebooks and paper mill to produce reproducible analytics reports.

Our millions of users spend 10+ hrs connected to the service on a typical working day.  The Slack data engineering team goal is simple: Drive up speed, efficiency, and reliability of making data-informed decisions. For engineers, For people managers, For salespeople, For every slack customer.  Airflow is the core system in our data infrastructure to orchestrate our data pipeline. We use Airflow to schedule Hive/ Tez, spark, Flink and TensorFlow applications. Airflow helps us to manage our stream processing, statistical analytics, machine learning, and deep learning pipelines.  About six months back, we started on-call rotation for our data pipeline to adopt what we learned from devops paradigm. We found out several airflow performance bottleneck and operational inefficiency that‚Äôs been siloed with ad-hoc pipeline management.  In this talk, I will speak about how we identified Airflow performance issues and fixed it. I will talk about our experience as we thrive to resolve our on-call nightmares and make data pipeline simpler and pleasant to operate and the hacks we did to improve alerting and visibility of our data pipeline.  Though the talk tune towards Airflow, the principles we applied for data pipeline visibility engineering is more generic and can apply to any tools/ data pipeline.  Ananth works as a Senior data engineer at Slack and manages core data infrastructures like Airflow, Kafka, Flink, and Pinot. He loves talking about all things ethical data management.

Speakers: Tim Williamson, Head of Product 360, Crop Science at Bayer  Session Description: An information revolution is upending the agricultural industry. In the last century, farm productivity and profitably dramatically increased with the advent of crop hybridization and biotech traits. The boundaries of corn, soybean, and cotton crop yields established by these innovations were broken by applying molecular techniques to produce more and heartier seed varieties. Pushing to develop new seed varieties now depends on combining data from disparate sources such as ancestry, genomic, phenotypic, and environmental observations. Each data source alone is complex and can contain decades of observations. This places highly variable demands on the systems necessary to inject and integrate their information content into high-scale, modern analytics use cases such as prescriptive breeding and genome-wide selection.  This talk will describe how Bayer is leading this agricultural information revolution with the creation of Bayer's distributed data services platform which backs its Crop Science product pipeline. We will tell the story of real-life choices in polyglot data engineering, distributed computation, and opinionated use of public cloud provider technology to present a humane and performant experience to our internal software engineering and data science teams. This story will be told through the lens of creating a computational platform capable of inferring the genotype of every seed produced during new product development.

Spark is not only a mature system, but thanks to its support of multiple resource managers like Hadoop, Mesos, and Kubernetes it has become a popular choice for both batch and streaming workloads in the industry.  Apache Beam has included a Spark runner since its inception to allow users to execute Beam pipelines on Spark, but until recently the Spark runner could only execute pipelines written in Java. In this talk we will introduce the portability framework and how we adapted it into the existing Spark runner translation to make the Spark runner portable.  We will show you how to execute Beam pipelines written in Python and Golang in Spark with Beam and invite you to use the new Spark Portable Runner. We will mention the use case of Tensorflow Extended, the end-to-end platform for data validation and transformation and ML model analysis. Finally we will discuss ongoing work and some future plans for the portable runner.

Now, with frameworks such as Apache Beam and Apache Airflow, we can schedule and run data processing jobs for both streaming and batch with the same underlying code.  This presentation demonstrates the concepts of how this can glue your applications together and shows how we can run a data pipeline from Apache Kafka through Hadoop Flink to Hive and move this to Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery by changing a few lines of Java in our Apache Beam code.  We will be looking at how this can be deployed in different cloud solutions, like Oracle Cloud or any other cloud out there.  Rustam Mehmandarov: Passionate computer scientist.

They ensure data is collected and organized in a timely and accurate manner, and is made available for analysis and modeling. In many cases, these pipelines require parallel computing. That might be because they involve ‚Äúbig compute‚Äù (many tasks to execute in parallel) or ‚Äúbig data‚Äù (large datasets which have to be processed in chunks). In this talk we‚Äôll introduce the next-generation stack for big data pipelines built upon Prefect and Dask, and compare it to popular tools like Spark, Airflow, and the Hadoop ecosystem. We‚Äôll discuss pros and cons of each, then take a deep dive into Prefect and Dask.  Dask is a Python-native parallel computing framework that can distribute computation of arbitrary Python functions up to high-level DataFrame and Array objects. It also has machine learning modules that are optimized to take advantage of these distributed data structures. Prefect is a workflow management system created by engineers who contributed to Airflow, and was specifically designed to address some of Airflow's shortcomings. It is built around the ‚Äúnegative engineering‚Äù paradigm - it takes care of all the little things that might go wrong in a data pipeline. Then when computations need to be distributed, Prefect integrates seamlessly with Dask clusters through its executor interface.

You add a few Apache Kafka clusters and a way to ingest data (probably over HTTP), design a way to route your data streams, add a few stream processors and consumers, integrate with a data warehouse... wait, this looks like a lot of things, doesn‚Äôt it? And you probably want to make it highly scalable and available too.   Join this session to learn best practices for building a data pipeline, drawn from my experience at Activision/Demonware. I'll share the lessons learned about scaling pipelines, not only in terms of volume, but also in terms of supporting more games and more use cases. You'll also hear about message schemas and envelopes, Apache Kafka organization, topics naming conventions, routing, reliable and scalable producers and the ingestion layer, as well as stream processing.  - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf1

Future of Data Meetup: Solving the "first mile" of the data pipeline problem can accelerate analytic	0	2021-05-12	clouderahadoop	152	8	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IYZp4bWMfB4/maxresdefault.jpg?v=60903470	1280	720	Science & Technology	hadoop|hadoop tutorial|data warehouse|data processing|apache hadoop|hbase|cloudera|hadoop training	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXY5wm6HlBL_Y_8SDxJNR0g	This meetup is for technical and leadership audiences who want to learn how modernizing a data pipeline can transform their business.  Enterprises today deploy many types of stream processing and analysis applications to satisfy their business needs. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a specific kind of enterprise application maintained to assist cybersecurity teams looking through billions of events to detect and prevent fraud and cyber attacks. Behind all of these applications are data pipelines used to collect, curate, and distribute data to support analytics.  As enterprises transition to collecting data from edge devices to either their on-premises data centers or the cloud, they realize that the traditional approach to data pipelines will not sustain the new need for faster, real-time analytics. For example, potential fraud indicators can no longer wait to be detected months after the fact when prevention needs to be done immediately.  In this meetup, Gal Shpantzer, a vCISO and Data Pipeline Architect, and Laura Chu, Senior Product Marketing Manager for Cloudera DataFlow, will discuss how Cloudera DataFlow, powered by MiNiFi, NiFi, and Kafka, became the basis for a new data pipeline that transformed a Fortune 500 company's analytics strategy.  At the meetup we will discuss: - Initial data pipeline challenges at the Fortune 500 company - Key components of Cloudera DataFlow - Apache MiNiFi, NiFi, and Kafka - Business value added by using Cloudera DataFlow for streaming data pipelines

The Slack data engineering team goal is simple: Drive up speed, efficiency, and reliability of making data-informed decisions. For engineers, For people managers, For salespeople, For every slack customer. Airflow is the core system in our data infrastructure to orchestrate our data pipeline. We use Airflow to schedule Hive/ Tez, spark, Flink and TensorFlow applications. Airflow helps us to manage our stream processing, statistical analytics, machine learning, and deep learning pipelines. About six months back, we started on-call rotation for our data pipeline to adopt what we learned from devops paradigm. We found out several airflow performance bottleneck and operational inefficiency that siloed with ad-hoc pipeline management. In this talk, I will speak about how we identified Airflow performance issues and fixed it. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch

Only, when the first problems arise, monitoring gets into focus. Then the first production issues often discover the weaknesses in the monitoring solutions: missing, lost or delayed data, reliability issues, etc. When things go wrong, the monitoring tool chain comes under more pressure and issues become visible. Apache Kafka is often advertised as a streaming platform, but delivering logs and metrics is one of the most common use cases. This talk will explain the main advantages of using Kafka as a data pipeline in monitoring applications such as Fluentd or Jaeger tracing. A demo will show how to use Strimzi CNCF project to set up this stack.    Schedule: https://sched.co/gmKu
952	Spark Summit	Building Realtime Data Pipelines with Kafka Connect & Spark Streaming by Ewen Cheslack-Postava	0	2017-02-14	TheApacheSpark	11623	74	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sq-2MrnhxtA/maxresdefault.webp	1280	720	Science & Technology	apache spark|spark summit east	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRzsq7k4-kT-h3TDUBQ82-w	Spark Streaming makes it easy to build scalable, robust stream processing applications ‚Äî but only once you‚Äôve made your data accessible to the framework. If your data is already in one of Spark Streaming‚Äôs well-supported message queuing systems, this is easy. If not, an ad hoc solution to import data may work for a single application, but trying to scale that approach to complex data pipelines integrating dozens of data sources and sinks with multi-stage processing quickly breaks down. Spark Streaming solves the realtime data processing problem, but to build large scale data pipeline we need to combine it with another tool that addresses data integration challenges.  The Apache Kafka project recently introduced a new tool, Kafka Connect, to make data import/export to and from Kafka easier. This talk will first describe some data pipeline anti-patterns we have observed and motivate the need for a tool designed specifically to bridge the gap between other data systems and stream processing frameworks. We will introduce Kafka Connect, starting with basic usage, its data model, and how a variety of systems can map to this model. Next, we‚Äôll explain how building a tool specifically designed around Kafka allows for stronger guarantees, better scalability, and simpler operationalization compared to other general purpose data copying tools. Finally, we‚Äôll describe how combining Kafka Connect and Spark Streaming, and the resulting separation of concerns, allows you to manage the complexity of building, maintaining, and monitoring large scale data pipelines.

Having excellent ML prototypes is great, but unless you are able to process large data quantities with it, you don‚Äôt have a product. Solving such a task is hard especially when you are restricted by budget and/or manpower. Big Data Systems Engineer Radek Strnad shares an example of a real product showing how to build an immutable pipeline with limited resources as a continuous evolution of an existing prototype and that scaling out can be approached as an ongoing process. Use of specific technologies is presented together with important gotchas that can help developers on a similar path.

User preferences also change in real time as they discover the latest selection being offered on the site. In such a dynamic environment, Machine Learning models for different applications (including search, recommendations or computational advertisement), need to collect different real time data signals, process them and finally leverage them to make the most relevant predictions.  In this talk we will detail how we use real-time feature logging to capture in-session / trending activities, build a typed unified feature store for sharing features across models from different domains and serve feature data at scale with the eventual goal of powering reactive systems. We will finally show how such a real-time ML data pipeline can be leveraged to build Reactive systems (Bandits / Reinforcement / Online learning applications) that can use state of the art ML algorithms to learn from user actions in real time.  apply(): The ML data engineering Conference Presented by Tecton  Connect with us: Slack: https://slack.feast.dev/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/tectonai/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/TectonAI

In order to be able to react to such events in close to real-time, you need to go beyond classical batch processing and utilize stream processing systems such as Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, or Apache Storm. These systems, however, are not sufficient on their own. For an efficient and fault-tolerant setup, you also need a message queue and storage system. One common example for setting up a fast data pipeline is the SMACK stack. SMACK stands for Spark (Streaming) - the stream processing system Mesos - the cluster orchestrator Akka - the system for providing custom actors for reacting upon the analyses Cassandra - the storage system Kafka - the message queue Setting up this kind of pipeline in a scalable, efficient and fault-tolerant manner is not trivial. First, this workshop will discuss the different components in the SMACK stack. Then, participants will get hands-on experience in setting up and maintaining data pipelines.

In this series, we have been covering all the topics related to Text Generation with sample implementations in Python. In this tutorial, we will focus on how to build an Efficient TensorFlow Data Pipeline for Character-Level Text Generation. First, we will download a sample corpus (text file). After opening the file and reading it line-by-line, we will convert it to a single line of text. Then, we will split the text into input character sequence (X) and output character (y). Using tf data API and Keras TextVectorization methods, we will preprocess the text, convert the characters into integer representation, prepare the training dataset, optimize the data pipeline. Thus, in the end, we will be ready to train a Language Model for character-level text generation.

Do not forget to turn on notifications so that you will be notified when new parts are uploaded. You can access this Colab Notebook using the link given in the video description below. What is a Data Pipeline? Data Pipeline is an automated process that involves in extracting, transforming, combining, validating, and loading data for further analysis and visualization.o It provides end-to-end velocity by eliminating errors and combatting bottlenecks or latency. It can process multiple data streams at once. In short, it is an absolute necessity for today‚Äôs data-driven solutions. If you are not familiar with data pipelines, you can check my tutorials in English or Turkish. Why Tensorflow Data Pipeline? The tf.data API enables us to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces. to handle large amounts of data, read from different data formats, and perform complex transformations. What can be done in a Text Data Pipeline? The pipeline for a text model might involve extracting symbols from raw text data, converting them to embedding identifiers with a lookup table, and batching together sequences of different lengths. What will we do in this Text Data pipeline? We will create a data pipeline to prepare training data for character-level text generator. Thus, in the pipeline, we will open & load corpus (text file) convert the text into a sequence of characters remove unwanted characters such as punctuations, HTML tags, white spaces, etc. generate input (X) and output (y) pairs as character sequences concatenate input (X) and output (y) into train data cache, prefetch, and batch the train data for performance LOAD TEXT DATA LINE BY LINE Since our aim is to prepare a train dataset for a character-level text generator, we need to convert the line-by-line text into char-by-char text. Therefore, we first combine all line-by-line text as a single text:we mentioned that we can train a language model and generate new text by using two different units: character level word level That is, you can split your text into sequence of characters or words. In this tutorial, we will focus on character level tokenization. If you would like to learn how to create word level tokenization please take a look at Part C. Check the size of the corpus The first sequence (input_chars) is the input data (X) to the model which will receive a fixed-size (maxlen) character sequence We need to process these datasets before feeding them into a model. Here, we will use the Keras preprocessing layer "TextVectorization". Why do we use Keras preprocessing layer? Because: The Keras preprocessing layers API allows developers to build Keras-native input processing pipelines. These input processing pipelines can be used as independent preprocessing code in non-Keras workflows, combined directly with Keras models, and exported as part of a Keras SavedModel. With Keras preprocessing layers, we can build and export models that are truly end-to-end: models that accept raw images or raw structured data as input; models that handle feature normalization or feature value indexing on their own. In the next part, we will create the end-to-end Text Generation model and we will see the benefits of using Keras preprocessing layers. What are the preprocessing steps? The processing of each sample contains the following steps: standardize each sample (usually lowercasing + punctuation stripping): split each sample into substrings (usually words): index tokens (associate a unique int value with each token) transform each sample using this index, either into a vector of ints or a dense float vector.

I'm excited to have Brian from ESG and Anu from IBM here. Anu, can you talk about a little bit about what is this project about the, uh, ESG validation report for IBM VDP and IBM costs?   Yes, absolutely, Chandra. So we worked with Actifio as well as ESG, where ESG did a benchmark, with IBM COS and IBM VDP, which is the IBM infrastructure virtual data pipeline, and is in this part of the effort. We took a real life database which was deployed in an Oracle RMAN rack in an IBM cloud data center in Dallas. We took that and took a snapshot of it, a moment in time and had that compressed into Actifio VDP and that was the use case that we had in the Dallas data center.   Great. So you took a copy in one data center of IBM, and then what did you do with the copy?   So the intent was to see what we can do with that block storage in IBM VDP that it has a capture of that database. So basically that was sent over the standard pipe, 10 gbps pipe over to IBM cloud service in Washington DC.  From there we were able to have VDP be our way to enable five clones of the virtual images that could be accessed by application developers to do their testing on these virtual images that are taking no additional capacity. So this again is the 17 terabyte gold copy, that is residing an IBM COS, enabled by the IBM VDP, enabling no additional space and allowing the developers to be able to do read and writes directly with these virtual copies, which are not taking any space and being able to do all of the performance querying and testing that they need to do todevelop their applications.   Awesome. Great. So you took a 50 terabyte Oracle database bagged it up, replicated it to IBM COS and from IBM COS you provision multiple database clones, it seems.   Yes.   All right. And Brian, how were your findings? What were the findings?   We wanted to verify that this process was easy and policy-based so that was easy and that it was fast and affordable and it actually checked the box on each of those. From the "easy" standpoint, everything is very policy-based. The GUI (graphical user interface) is great and there's restful API so you can use API magic. The time they would take using traditional methods, we estimated it would take up to 14 days actually making full volume copies. That shrinks down to about an hour, a little bit over an hour with the virtual copies are almost instantaneous. But based on  policy definitions for those developers, we're able to spin up the Oracle environment for them.That took a little bit of time and get that point in time image for them ready to go. We were making copies every hour. So it's very easy and policy based. Next, we next we wanted to see what's the performance.  It's not obvious that you take a mission critical database that's used to running on block, usually mission critical, best in class storage and put it on cloud object.  The perception is not going to be fast. We're actually pleasantly surprised.  We ran the exact same queries, both simple and complex on 600 million rows took about two minutes to do a simple query. It took about eight minutes to do a complex query on COS, which is plenty good enough in our opinion for functional test development. We're actually pleasantly surprised.  It was actually faster on the cloud object storage. Last but at least, we looked at the economics of the situation and mostly due to the savings due to COS storage it was 79% less compared to legacy or traditional methods.   Awesome. So 79% savings. What is the biggest saving component in that?   It's the cost of the storage through where the copies are going to live. Right? So that the old ways of doing things, you would mirror, you know, mission critical storage to mission critical storage and it needs to be the same. That's the old way. And so that second copy usually cost you as much. In this case, we're able to take that and use the virtual data pipeline technology powered by Actifio to make that transparently use object, which is much, much more affordable. You can buy that for pennies per gig per month. That's what we did for this test, but also could be deployed on prem if you'd like. There's a software only version of it that you can do.    So to summarize, five virtual copies of a 50 terabyte Oracle database was provisioned straight out of IBM COS, and that's where you saw the time shrink and the cost rink.   Yes. Correct.   And the queries ran for 600 million rows in just two minutes.   Yup.   Straight out of the IBM COS.   Yep.   Awesome! Thank you for those results. They sound very exciting. Thank you, Anu. Thank you Brian. Thank you all.

For accurate and timely analytics, it requires clean and real-time data which is why data teams emphasize building data pipelines in the first place.  One of the greatest dilemmas in creating data pipelines is finalizing the approach, whether to go with custom scripts or build an in-house solution or buy a ready-made solution available in the market. So in this webinar, we will focus on understanding which one of these three data pipeline approaches will work best for your use case and how you can streamline the entire data pipeline process to ensure success.  In this webinar you will learn:  1) What changes when you move to Big Data 2) The real-world challenges for data-driven business 3) The transition from ETL to Data Pipeline 4) Build Vs Buy: which approach is better and why 5) Factors to consider while finalizing the data pipeline tool  ABOUT THE SPEAKER:  Pradeep Sharma is a VP of Engineering at Lendingkart where he leads the platform engineering vertical and looks after data engineering, platform development, and customer lifecycle management.

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NXL8-KCuSRKJWIKi9IfJ6fJ0LitdGZNc4l0Ww1JfX_0/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000 Event: http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2016-nyc/  Arbor is the marketplace for people-based data. Trace the path that led Arbor to build their data pipeline on Google Container Engine (GKE), and share lessons and recommendations from the Arbor team's journey.  Arbor's role in the adtech sector means serving 20,000 HTTP requests per second and processing hundreds of gigabytes of data daily. Joshua will describe the story of how, after experiencing some scary pain points with their Fleet-based stack, the Arbor engineering team decided to give Kubernetes a shot, and how doing so has benefited the company in terms of flexibility, stability and scalability.  He'll talk about why Arbor opted for Google Container Engine as the most suitable way of managing their Kubernetes stack, and will touch on some of the benefits of running on GKE vs. using one of many "Kubernetes management platforms" out there.  Joshua will describe what Arbor's data pipeline looks like today, and will share some "lessons learned" and recommendations from Arbor's experience. He'll close with a brief look at what's next for the team, and upcoming Kubernetes and GKE features that Arbor is especially excited about.

As autonomous vehicle technologies continue to evolve, the data generated inside the vehicle only continues to grow exponentially. All of this data needs to be streamed, processed, stored, and analyzed in real time, offline at control centers, or by the auto company for quality improvements.    The need for data pipeline toolchains has led to vendors offering commercial versions that are either proprietary or complicated, leading to vendor lock-in. More importantly, these commercial products have a difficult time keeping up with technology changes, resulting in their products becoming obsolete even before they hit production.

It helps many companies answer questions like, 'which of my products are people adding to their cart?' or 'What does our online purchase funnel look like?'  But our AWS Practice Lead, Keith Gregory, argues that this data can also be used to make business operations smoother, or introduce entirely new procedures.   In this interview, Keith breaks down how his team implemented a new data pipeline for a sportsbook betting application, connecting their brick-and-mortar rewards program to their virtual users. He walks through the process of collecting the data, cleaning the data, and correctly funneling it to the correct places - all while maintaining observability and reliability.  The result? A feature that added a billion dollars of valuation to the client business, and a source of pride for the Chariot team that made it happen.

The point of this assignment was to incorporate Kubernetes into an existing cloud data pipeline architecture such that software that was previously being installed directly on cloud VMs (created with AWS EC2) is now installed in Docker images, and these images are used to create Docker containers that are orchestrated via Kubernetes in the forms of Kubernetes Deployments and Services. Our previous Ansible playbooks were modified and extended to now include the installation of Kubernetes on the cloud infrastructure, and subsequently the initialization of a Kubernetes cluster consisting of all created cloud VMs plus the kickoff of the Kubernetes deployments and services from the Kubernetes master.

Automated testing has been one of the biggest productivity boosters in modern software development and essential for managing complex codebases. Data science and engineering have been largely missing out on automated testing. This talk introduces Great Expectations, an open-source python framework for bringing data pipelines and products under test. Great Expectations is a python framework for bringing data pipelines and products under test. Like assertions in traditional python unit tests, Expectations provide a flexible, declarative language for describing expected behavior. Unlike traditional unit tests, Great Expectations applies Expectations to data instead of code. We strongly believe that most of the pain caused by accumulating pipeline debt is avoidable.  We built Great Expectations to make it very, very simple to:  -Set up your testing framework early -Capture those early learnings while they‚Äôre still fresh -Systematically validate new data against them. It‚Äôs the best tool we know of for managing the complexity that inevitably grows within data pipelines. -We hope it helps you as much as it‚Äôs helped us. Main takeaways:  This talk will teach you how to use Great Expectations to get more done with data, faster -Save time during data cleaning and munging. -Accelerate ETL and data normalization. -Streamline analyst-to-engineer handoffs. -Monitor data quality in production data pipelines and data products. -Simplify debugging for data pipelines if (when) they break.

Apache Spark has matured into a very popular framework for data analytics that‚Äìwhen combined with other technologies found in Lightbend Fast Data Platform like Akka Streams, Kafka and Mesos‚Äìhelps businesses accelerate decision making and become reactive to the particular characteristics of their market.     Spark combines various libraries like SQL-based analytics, Fast Data flow processing, graph analytics and a rich library of built-in machine learning algorithms to address a wide range of requirements for large-scale data analytics. But how can you know which part to use for the right job?     In this talk by Gerard Maas, O‚ÄôReilly author and Senior Software Engineer at Lightbend, we focus on choosing the right Fast Data stream processing features of Apache Spark, taking a practical, code-driven look at the two APIs available for this: the mature Spark Streaming and its younger sibling, Structured Streaming. Specifically, we will review:  - The capabilities of Spark's APIs for streaming and their key differences  - Advice on making the right choice for an application and how to architect and develop streaming pipelines that use one or both APIs to fulfill its requirements  - A code-based demo on getting started with both the Spark Streaming and Structured Streaming APIs

You'll see how to pull in marketing data, custom data from your organization (like client lists, management fees, and custom insights), analyze it and visualize it using the blazing fast BigQuery engine.  This hangout is based in large part on The Coding is for Losers Agency Data Pipeline Course and a method taught to us by Nico Brooks from Two Octobers.  On this episode we walk through how to set up a solution that gathers data in Google Sheets with Supermetrics.  We then use the Google Sheets tabs as external tables in BigQuery. We then use a killer tool called DBT from Fishtown Analytics to build an aggregated reporting table in BigQuery that we can then visualize in Google Data Studio.  We were super Lucky to have Lee Hurst (@Helpfullee on Twitter), a Google Data Studio Expert join us on the episode.  He shared a number of ingenious hacks with us at the end of the hangout.

For each event in the Kafka topic, the latest value for each key is held in a table. In this course, Tim Berglund (Senior Director of Developer Experience, Confluent) demonstrates the concept of turning a stream into a table and then shows how that table can be used as a lookup table to which another stream of events can be joined, creating an enriched event.

We have worked over the past year to review different pipeline tools that allow us to quickly combine steps to create new workflows or operate on new datasets. We have reviewed Dagster, Apache Spark MLflow pipelines, Prefect, and our own custom solutions. The talk will go over the pros and cons of each of these solutions and will show an actionable workflow implementation that any geospatial analyst can leverage. We will show how we can leverage a pipeline to run a traditional geospatial hotspot analysis. Interactive mapping within the Databricks platform will be demonstrated.

In this lab you explore the Cloud Dataprep UI to build a data transformation pipeline that runs at a scheduled interval and outputs results into BigQuery.  The dataset you'll use is an ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics session records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery. You have a copy of that dataset for this lab and will explore the available fields and row for insights.  Objectives In this lab, you learn how to perform these tasks: - Connect BigQuery datasets to Cloud Dataprep. - Explore dataset quality with Cloud Dataprep. - Create a data transformation pipeline with Cloud Dataprep. - Schedule transformation jobs outputs to BigQuery.  What you'll need - The Google Chrome browser. Other browsers are currently not supported by Cloud Dataprep.

Using a CPU runtime, I first run a simple Hugging Face example based on the Pipeline API. Then, I switch to a GPU runtime and run a fine-tuning example on DistilBERT with the Trainer API. Along the way, I inspect the infrastructure resources available in both runtimes. I also show you how to create your own conda environment to keep your dependencies neatly organized.  ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Don't forget to subscribe to be notified of future videos ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è  New to Transformers?

To enroll in this free course, follow this link: https://academy.streamsets.com/courses/dataops-platform-fundamentals/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dataops-platform  In this video, we build a Snowflake pipeline that writes data to Snowflake tables. The destination stages CSV files to either an internal or external stage, then sends a command to Snowflake to process the stage files.  You can write new data or CDC data to Snowflake. When processing new data, the destination can load data using the copy command, or Snowpipe, which can improve performance. When processing Change Data Capture data, the destination uses the merge command.

However, published data tables exist in a gray area; they are static enough not to be considered a ‚Äúservice‚Äù or ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù, yet too raw to earn attentive user interface design. This ambiguity creates a disconnect between data producers and consumers and poses a risk for analytical correctness and reproducibility.  In this talk, I will explain how controlled vocabularies can be used to form contracts between data producers and data consumers. Explicitly embedding meaning in each component of variable names is a low-tech and low-friction approach that builds a shared understanding of how each field in the dataset is intended to work.

Such analysis has catalyzed the efforts in applying such new arithmetic for various applications domains viz. scientific, signal processing, AI/ML etc. This work presents a Posit Arithmetic Unit (P16, P32, P64, quire: parameterizable) enabled RISC-V processor (RV64IMAFD) architected with 6-stages in-order pipeline and FreeRTOS bootable. The RISC-V processor supports either IEEE 754-2008 FP or Posit (RISC-V F and D ISA based) arithmetic. The Posit unit has been verified with an in-house developed Posit domain specific verification suite, PositGen. RISC-V GCC software toolchain has been suitably enhanced to support Posit data representation in applications. Posit enabled RISC-V core and IEEE 754-2008 FP enabled RISC-V core have been evaluated independently with a set of computational programs and the results have been compared and analyzed for accuracy. Further, Posit and IEEE 754-2008 FPU unit has been compared and analyzed for hardware resources (area) complexity and latency.

You also need the right tools to make sense from all this data to prioritize and take action. In this upcoming Developer Productivity Engineering meetup we talk to Grant Jenks from the Developer Insights team. For the last three years, Grant has worked at LinkedIn in the Developer Productivity and Happiness organization on the Developer Insights team. Developer Insights works like a ‚ÄúFitbit for engineering teams‚Äù to identify and improve pain points in developer workflows. We‚Äôll explore the platform they built to improve the productivity of their engineers to ultimately ship new and better features to LinkedIn users.  Table of Contents: 00:01:10- What is the size, structure and scope of productivity engineering organization? 00:03:34 - What data are you collecting/analyzing and what tools do you use? What does it mean to measure productivity and happiness? What framework do you use for improving productivity? How has the Developer Insights work evolved in the last few years? What was your biggest productivity engineering win and what were the lessons learned? How do you measure build speed across such a large organization? How do you accommodate both the executive wanting a 10,000 foot view and the Senior IC wanting nitty gritty details? 00:30:10 - What impact has flaky tests had on your CI pipeline? 00:33:48 - How do you track and measure flakiness in the infrastructure, tests, and other sources? 00:37:22 - How do you measure quality? What is the role of code reviews and how do you correlate code coverage with issues, tickets and crashes?  00:46:21 - What is your DevProd team moonshot?  #developerproductivity #developerproductivityengineering #gradle #maven #android #jdk

ETL is a data integration pattern that emerged in the 1970s where you Extract data from multiple applications and other sources, Transform it, and then Load it into different targets. It is most commonly used for loading data into data warehouses. But it is also widely used for data migration (from one application or database to another), for loading data marts, for operational data synchronization and master data management; even application integration.  ETL became associated with data integration vendors such as Informatica. But there were other variants, such as ELT. For example, people would use Informatica to Extract and Load data into Teradata, where they would then Transform data using TQL (Teradata Query Language.) ELT became popular with data lakes where you would load raw data and transform it later when needed. It helped shorten the time it took to create new reports. People may see ELT as the newer approach, and ETL as older. But in reality many companies do ETLTLTLTL across their data pipelines.  There is also some TEL in blockchains. But for the most part the software industry has limited the variations to ETL and ELT.  Hopefully it will not LET other variations happen ...   https://www.firebolt.io/glossary-items/etl-and-elt   #ETL #ELT #Firebolt

Many of these tools facilitate the initial development and deployment of ML applications, contributing to a crowded landscape of disconnected solutions targeted at different stages, or components, of the ML lifecycle. A lack of end-to-end ML pipeline visibility makes it hard to address any issues that may arise after a production deployment, such as unexpected output values or lower-quality predictions. We introduce our prototype and our vision for mltrace, a platform-agnostic system that provides observability to ML practitioners by (1) executing predefined tests and monitoring ML-specific metrics at component runtime, (2) tracking end-to-end data flow, and (3) allowing users to ask arbitrary post-hoc questions about pipeline health.

Tedros added that countries around the world must stay vigilant with surveillance, testing and sequencing as the Omicron variant spreads and could have a major impact on the course of the pandemic.  He also said according to emerging data from South Africa, there's evidence of increased risk of reinfection with Omicron, but more data is needed to draw firmer conclusions. There's also some evidence the Omicron variant causes milder disease than the Delta variant of the coronavirus.  Earlier this month, WHO officials in the Western Pacific said border closures adopted by some countries may buy time to delay the Omicron COVID-19 variant, but measures put in place and experience gained in dealing with the Delta variant should remain the foundation for fighting the pandemic.  While a few countries are facing surges, COVID-19 cases and deaths in many others have decreased and plateaued, WHO regional director for the Western Pacific Dr. Takeshi Kasai told reporters in a virtual news conference earlier this week.

Are there software design paradigms that simply do not work for you?  In this presentation, I lean on the research of Dr. Margaret Burnett, who studies the intersection of software design and cognitive diversity. Her thesis is that narrow-minded software design alienates people who are not neurotypical with respect to the assumed average user.  I believe dbt was designed with cognitive diversity in mind, which is its primary value-add over similar software solutions. This presentation outlines some inclusive design paradigms that make dbt a leader in the data governance space.

The President does not control gas prices, and the policies of this administration have had ZERO impact on them, but Republicans will never let a good lie die.

Well folks it's happening all across America. It's happening in Congress. It's happening in conservative media. It's happening in conversations with your neighbors, your friends, your coworkers, Republicans and conservatives are blaming Joe Biden for gas prices being so darn high here in the United States. Truth is they're really not that much higher than usual. And they're certainly not at the highest level they've ever been. So, alright. Not to mention the fact, and I think this is the most important thing that we should talk about, the president doesn't set gas prices and there isn't a single policy so far that has come out from the Biden administration that has affected gas prices in the least. And I know Republicans at that point will jump on it and say, oh, you're so wrong, Farron, you should learn about the Keystone XL pipeline that he shut down earlier this year.  Oh, you mean the pipeline that wasn't in operation? You mean the pipeline that was carrying Canadian tar sands oil to the Gulf Coast to be shipped out overseas? That one? Yeah. That had no effect on gas prices here in the United States. As I said, most of it wasn't operational to begin with. Like it wasn't even a thing. It wasn't a thing. I have been writing about, I have been giving interviews, I have been taking interviews on the Keystone XL pipeline for over a decade. Like that one's right in my wheelhouse and I absolutely love talking about the Keystone XL pipeline. And I'm glad that I don't have to talk about it anymore except of course, to debunk idiotic right wing talking points about it somehow affecting gas prices here in the United States. But let's be honest. Conservatives don't care. They don't wanna understand the economics behind gas prices.  So I'm gonna throw out a couple numbers that maybe even the most ardent conservatives in this country can understand as we face a time of rising gas prices. While rising gasoline prices have adversely affected millions of working people in the US, the world's big fossil fuel corporations have benefited immensely raking in a combined $174 billion in profits during the first nine months of this year. In the third quarter of 2021 alone, two dozen of the most profitable oil and gas companies, a group that includes Shell, BP, Exxon and Chevron, recorded $74.9 billion in net income, net income in third quarter. Gas prices are artificially higher right now because oil companies can do it and they're the ones getting all the profits. That has nothing to do with Joe Biden. That has everything to do with corporate greed. Here's another fact that conservatives are conveniently overlooking, but Democrats are paying attention to because it's frigging horrible.  Public Citizen showed in a report this week that since Biden took office, the interior department's bureau of land management has approved an average of 333 oil and gas drilling permits per month this year, 40% more than it did in the first three years of Trump's presidency. So we're about to have more drilling than ever, you know, we actually that during the Obama administration. We're about to go back to that, 333 permits per month, 333 per month. Not just 333 new permits for drilling on federal lands this year, 333 per month.

In response to cyber threat actors, IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) are being provided to help us take some countermeasures. In this paper, we analyse how the coronavirus-based cyber attack unfolded on the academic infrastructure network SINET (The Science Information Network) based on the passive measurement with IoC. SINET is Japan's academic information infrastructure network. To extract and analyze the traffic patterns of the COVID-19 attacker group, we implemented a data flow pipeline for handling huge session traffic data observed on SINET. The data flow pipeline provides three functions: (1) identification the direction of the traffic, (2) filtering the port numbers, and (3) generation of the time series data. From the output of our pipeline, it is clear that the attacker's traffic can be broken down into several patterns. To name a few, we have witnessed (1) huge burstiness (port 25: FTP and high port applications), (3) diurnal patterns (port 443: SSL), and (3) periodic patterns with low amplitude (port 25: SMTP) We can conclude that some unveiled patterns by our pipeline are informative to handling security operations of the academic backbone network. Particularly, we have found burstiness of high port and unknown applications with the number of session data ranging from 10,000 to 35,000. For understanding the traffic patterns on SINET, our data flow pipeline can utilize any IoC based on the list of IP address for traffic ingress/egress identification and port filtering.  Keywords COVID-19 related IoC, traffic patterns, data flow pipeline, port filtering, SINET, high port application  Abstract URL: http://aircconline.com/abstract/ijnsa/v13n6/13621ijnsa03.html  Full Text URL: https://aircconline.com/ijnsa/V13N6/13621ijnsa03.pdf  Volume URL: https://airccse.org/journal/jnsa21_current.html

Among all the charts, figures, and PR speak was a curious white concept vehicle wearing a Chrysler crest. There's no question about it being an evolution of the Airflow Vision concept that Chrysler unveiled in 2020, but we were only given a brief view.  Flash forward to another special Stellantis event, this one called Software Day. The conglomerate unveiled its intention to morph into a tech company while also being a car company, outlining a strategy for developing software and computer systems in-house that will, among other things, theoretically bring Stellantis an additional $20 billion in revenue by 2030. Showcasing some of that tech, however, was the same concept we saw in July only now we know it's called Airflow. The concept was a backdrop during the live portions of the Software Day presentation, but midway through the event, a segment featuring Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares driving the Airflow took center stage. We have the video above set to start when the segment begins, and you know what? It looks pretty much production-ready.   The video didn't discuss details of the concept, but we do see the Airflow from several angles inside and out, revealing a five-passenger crossover with a glass cockpit that looks fully functional. Perhaps most interesting, Stellantis Chief Software Officer Yves Bonnefont introduced the video segment by saying "it's closer than you think, and more than a pure concept." We know Stellantis has plans to launch a range of new battery electric vehicles. We also know Chrysler is seriously hurting for something new and interesting. The Pacifica minivan is a solid offering, available in standard and hybrid trim. The only other Chrysler product is the well-aged 300 sedan, so a new EV with smart styling could be just the thing to revitalize the storied brand. There's also a classic connection with the Airflow name, as it was used by Chrysler in the 1930s for a short-lived but striking full-size vehicle that sought better aerodynamic efficiency.  Could we be on the cusp of seeing a new aerodynamically efficient EV for Chrysler? The 2022 Consumer Electronics Show is barely a month away, and Stellantis has another big announcement scheduled for the spring. If those dates don't yield results, Stellantis will have its tech plans well underway by 2024.

Bitfenix and Cooler Master have both shown installation procedures that can actually kill the cooler, while pretty much everyone else has shown some form of sub-optimal installation that will minimally hurt the acoustic performance of coolers. In instances of mini-ITX cases like the Cooler Master NR200P, we've noticed a lot of build photos on forums online (and in YouTube media, but we don't blame the YTers or builders for overlooking this) installing coolers bottom-mounted. This, we think, isn't an issue with the reviewers or the PC building enthusiasts, but with the educational materials provided with the cases. The fact that there is an explicitly mentioned bottom-mount for radiators in a case where it's very likely to be used is a problem, and any case with such a mount should include warnings against installing closed-loop liquid coolers with block-mounted pumps in these positions. Installing a custom loop bypasses this issue, since the pump is almost never going to be in the block, and therefore should never be at the top of the loop (it's more likely to be in the middle of the loop). But AIO CPU coolers should not ever be bottom-mounted with the pump at the top of the loop. Manufacturer websites (shown in this video) also commonly show front-mounted radiators with tubes at the top, which will become noisy as permeation increases, and sometimes can be noisy immediately. This video is a PSA to try and help reduce pump whine, pump noise, and prevent liquid coolers from dying early or overheating.  Like our content?

The airflow device uses a very fine powder with high pressure air and water to clean the plaque off teeth like a spa experience.   Watch the video to see how we clean teeth from start to finish at Dentista Dental Centre using the Airflow Master.  I have been a practicing Dentist in Morley, Perth Western Australia since 2009. With these videos I hope to inform and educate ways to improve your oral health, and explain common dental procedures. Through this channel I hope to take away some of the fear and unknown when it comes to visiting the dentist!  For more info visit our website at https://www.dentista.com.au  For more pictures of üòÉ Follow me on IG: https://www.instagram.com/drcarlathedentista/ Follow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/drcarlathedentista   Transcript: Hi everybody, this is Dr Carla and this is my lovely patient Zahra. Today we‚Äôre going to be talking a little bit about the Airflow Master and why it‚Äôs so good. Here we have the Airflow, and this is where the magic happens. This is the powder, and this is what‚Äôs going to clean Zahra‚Äôs teeth. It‚Äôs a tiny tiny little particle, it‚Äôs only 14 microns in size which is so tiny that when you feel it, it just feels very soft. The result it that your teeth get a really soft gentle clean, and nothing gets scratched, and it‚Äôs the only thing that can clean under your implants, if you have implants, without damaging them. So we‚Äôre going to give it a try.  So we‚Äôre just going to put some Vaseline on Zahra‚Äôs lips here. And now we‚Äôre going to use this here, this is the guided Biofilm Therapy, this is the disclosing solution. This is going to show us where there‚Äôs any plaque or biofilm on Zahra‚Äôs teeth. That will tell us where we need to clean, and also where Zahra might be missing. So we just rub it on like this. It‚Äôs berry flavour, didn‚Äôt taste like berries to me!  Beautiful, what we do now, is get our Airflow, which warms the water to 40 degrees, which is nice and warm. You can see where Zahra is not quite getting 100% with the toothbrush. Which is great, because it‚Äôs so hard to know if you‚Äôre cleaning properly because you can‚Äôt see it when it‚Äôs tooth coloured. But now we‚Äôll give Zahra the mirror and we‚Äôre just going to go through a quick little demo of where she can get to with the toothbrush. And, often guys, it‚Äôs just a matter of using a brand new toothbrush!  Because, if you‚Äôve had the same bristles there for 5-6 months they‚Äôre not effective. So even if you‚Äôre getting there the bristles just aren‚Äôt doing the work. So I think maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on. And another common thing here with people is that their bottom lip gets the brush out the way. So if you‚Äôre brushing here and your lip is covering your bottom teeth what you‚Äôve got to do is push your bottom lip down a little bit and make sure you get right down to the gum line.  So what we‚Äôre going to do now is use the Airflow and clean all the staining off!  C: Beautiful! Alright so Zahra how did you find the Airflow clean?  Z: So it really didn‚Äôt feel like a clean! It just felt like water!  C: It‚Äôs strange isn‚Äôt it. Because normally when you have a clean there‚Äôs a certain level of discomfort with the scratching and the poking. Z: It was quite nice, it actually felt like you didn‚Äôt do anything!   C: yeah I know! But you saw all that purple gone right! And even when we did the ultrasonic. When you have that normally done with the dental chair it feels very cold. How would you describe that the water felt in your mouth when we did it just now? Z: fine. I didn‚Äôt feel it. It didn‚Äôt feel cold or anything.  C: great! Alright, would you recommend it to other people to have an Airflow clean as opposed to a regular clean? What‚Äôs your preference? Z: yeah! If you like feeling nothing at the dentist, then this is the way to go!  C: Alright well beautiful! You have a very healthy mouth, so I look forward to seeing you in six months time! Z: thank you Carla! C: you‚Äôre very welcome!

Welcome TaskGroups! In Airflow 2.0, you should forget about SubDAGs as a new easier, more efficient concept just comes in, TASKGROUP!  üëç Smash the like button to become an Airflow Super Hero! ‚ù§Ô∏è Subscribe to my channel to become a master of Airflow  üèÜ Take my course : https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-hands-on-course-to-master-apache-airflow/?couponCode=WEBSITE-13 to join the legends of Airflow üö® My Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/marclamberti to support my work and be friend for life  1. Problem SubDAGs are complex. Too complex for their goal. Before Airflow 2.0, to group tasks, you had to define SubDAGs. To define a SubDAG you need 3 things. First, import the SubdagOperator. Second, create a python function returning a DAG. Third, instantiate a new DAG just to group the tasks in that python function. You had to take care of the executor, potential deadlocks, if the default arguments are well shared between the parent DAG and the Subdag, checking if the id of the SubDAG is well formatted and so on. TOO MUCH COMPLEXITY! Well, that's come to an end.  2. Solution TaskGroups! Since Airflow 2.0, you can forget about SubDAGs and start leveraging the power of TaskGroups. No need to create a python function, to instantiate a DAG, to use an Operator, no need of that. The ONLY thing you have to do is to import the TaskGroup class. Then, instantiate a TaskGroup, put your tasks under the task group and THAT'S IT.    3. Benefits TaskGroups are much easier to use, faster to implement, less prone to errors and efficient. They do what SubDAG do but in a much better way. You won't have to take care of potential deadlocks. Pools are respected, the executor is the same as the one you use for all of your tasks (By default, the sequential executor is set to the SubDAGOperator). Go with TaskGroups :) 5. BranchPythonOperator task skipped When a task is not triggered by the BranchPythonOperator, it is skipped. The problem is, if you have a task which depends both on the skipped task and the task triggered by the BranchPythonOperator, that task will be skipped as well. Why? Trigger rules! By default, if one of the parents of a task is skipped, then the task is skipped as well. You can fix this with the trigger rule none_failed_or_skipped  Enjoy!

Use case You have a data pipelines with 3 different tasks. The first is_api_available checks if the API is available or not. Next, if the API is available you execute the task Download, but if NOT you want to execute is_api_available_2 first and then the task Download. How can you do that? How can you choose what task or another according to a condition? The BranchPythonOperator!   2. What is the  BranchPythonOperator? The BranchPythonOperator allows to choose a specific path in your DAG according to a criterion. More specifically, it returns the task id of the NEXT task to execute based on a condition/value etc.  3. How to use the BranchPythonOperator Really simple, you import the BranchPythonOperator. You implement it. You have to pass a python callable function. That function is triggered by the BranchPythonOperator like with the PythonOperator but this time, the function must return the task id of the next task to execute. Finally, specify the dependencies between your tasks.  4. The BranchPythonOperator with XComs Be careful. Each time a BranchPythonOperator is triggered, 2 XComs are created. XComs are not removed automatically. If you have hundreds of BranchPythonOperators, you will store a lot of XComs. To mitigate this, specify the parameter do_xcom_push in the BranchPythonOperator to only generate one XCom instead of one.  5. BranchPythonOperator task skipped When a task is not triggered by the BranchPythonOperator, it is skipped. The problem is, if you have a task which depends both on the skipped task and the task triggered by the BranchPythonOperator, that task will be skipped as well. Why? Trigger rules! By default, if one of the parents of a task is skipped, then the task is skipped as well. You can fix this with the trigger rule none_failed_or_skipped  6. BranchPythonOperator multiple task ids You can definitely choose to execute multiple tasks with the BranchPythonOperator. You just have to return a list of task ids instead of a task id.  Enjoy!

1197	EuroPython Conference	Micha≈Ç Karzy≈Ñski - Developing elegant workflows in Python code with Apache Airflow	0	2017-10-21	PythonItalia	31262	393	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XJf-f56JbFM/maxresdefault.webp	1920	1080	Science & Technology		https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC98CzaYuFNAA_gOINFB0e4Q	"Developing elegant workflows in Python code with Apache Airflow [EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Anfiteatro 1] [Rimini, Italy]  Every time a new batch of data comes in, you start a set of tasks. Some tasks can run in parallel, some must run in a sequence, perhaps on a number of different machines. That's a workflow.  Did you ever draw a block diagram of your workflow? Imagine you could bring that diagram to life and actually run it as it looks on the whiteboard. With Airflow you can just about do that.  http://airflow.apache.org Apache Airflow is an open-source Python tool for orchestrating data processing pipelines. In each workflow tasks are arranged into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Shape of this graph decides the overall logic of the workflow. A DAG can have many branches and you can decide which of them to follow and which to skip at execution time.  This creates a resilient design because each task can be retried multiple times if an error occurs. Airflow can even be stopped entirely and running workflows will resume by restarting the last unfinished task. Logs for each task are stored separately and are easily accessible through a friendly web UI.  In my talk I will go over basic Airflow concepts and through examples demonstrate how easy it is to define your own workflows in Python code. We'll also go over ways to extend Airflow by adding custom task operators, sensors and plugins.

As part of single docker-compsoe file, we will spin up following services:  1. airflow-init: initializes airflow database schema and creates admin user 2. airflow-scheduler: runs airflow scheduler in LocalExecutor 3. airflow-webserver: runs airflow webserver exposing on port 8081 4. mysql: runs mysql database for airflow metadata 5. statsd-exporter: service that converts airflow statsd metrics to Prometheus metrics  6. Prometheus: runs Prometheus service that scraps airflow metrics from statsd-exporter 7. Grafana: runs Grafana instance where our final dashboards will be available.   ---------------------------------------------------  üëç If this video was helpful to you, please don't forget to thumbs-up,  ‚å®Ô∏è leave a comment and  üîó share with your friends.   ‚≠ê Support our work by hitting that subscribe button.  üîî hit bell icon to stay alert on more upcoming interesting stuff.  ---------------------------------------------------  Timeline:  00:00 Intro  00:56 Monitoring data flow 01:41 Airflow metrics configs 02:01 Write docker-compose file 03:15 writing statsd-exporter service 04:02 statsd config mapping 06:01 test metrics  08:42 outro -----------------------------------------------  Get complete code from here; https://github.com/maxcotec/Apache-Airflow/tree/main/Monitoring_Dag  Grafana and StatsD configs  https://github.com/databand-ai/airflow-dashboards  Statsd python client  https://github.com/jsocol/pystatsd   Watch the previous video here: Run Airflow locally via Docker  https://youtu.be/28UI_Usxbqo

We wanted to provide an outline for what ETL tools are. You could refer to these ETL tools as workflow tools that help manage moving data from point A to point B.  Two of these popular workflow tools are Luigi by Spotify and Airflow by Airbnb. Both of these workflow engines have been developed to help in the design and execution of computationally heavy workflows that are used for data analysis.   If you need data consulting help, then reach out to our team here: https://www.theseattledataguy.com/‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã  Also, if you'd like to read up on my updates about the data field, then you can sign up for our newsletter here. https://seattledataguy.substack.com/‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã  Check out my Medium here: https://medium.com/@SeattleDataGuy‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã  Watch our video on the skills you need to be a data engineer then you can watch the one below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSHaOvNodA&t=5s  What Is a DAG?  Now before comparing Airflow to Luigi, it‚Äôs important we understand an important concept both libraries have in common. Both, essentially, build what is known as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG is a collection of tasks that run in a specific order with dependencies on previous tasks.  For example, if we had three tasks named Foo, Bar, and FooBar, it might be the case that Foo runs first and Bar and FooBar depend on Foo finishing.  This would create a basic graph like the one below. As you can see, there‚Äôs a clear path. Now imagine this with tens of hundreds of tasks.  Large data organizations have massive DAGs with dependencies on dependencies. Having clear access to the DAG allows companies to track where things are going wrong and doesn‚Äôt allow bad data into their data ecosystems because if something fails, it‚Äôll often force the tasks downstream to wait until their dependencies are complete.  This is where tools like Airflow and Luigi come in handy.

Both organizations are focused on repairability of products, reduction of e-waste, and legal protections for consumers to truly own maintain their own devices.  This review of the Corsair 7000D Airflow & Corsair 7000X looks at thermals, noise, and build quality. These cases are built for larger computers, so water cooling is highly compatible with the chassis, as are large motherboards ("E-ATX," although there are issues with EATX in this case). The Corsair 7000D Airflow follows-up the Corsair 5000D & 4000D, so we compare the three cases in this review. We'll also look at the 7000D vs. the Fractal Meshify 2 XL, Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2, and Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL. Large tower cases are a smaller market and highly competitive, so the 7000D has a hard fight ahead of it.

The goal is to compare gaming PC cases for best CPU or GPU temperatures, best noise-normalized temperatures (or acoustic performance), and best build quality at each price class for 2020 so far. This includes cases that have come out in previous years, so our criteria was centered around cases available right now rather than only things that have launched recently, since it's not like cases age on the shelves. We'll run another piece on the best and worst cases toward end of year, and that'll be a wider-scope look at computer cases for different categories. In this one, we're talking about budget cases, mid-range cases, and high-end cases, which we've split into ~$60 to ~$80 cases, sub-$100 enclosures, and cases north of that. We're comparing the Lian Li Lancool II Mesh, the P500A, NR600, Phanteks P300A, be quiet! Pure Base 500DX, Cooler Master TD500, and more.  CASES LISTED (in order of appearance)  Note: Due to constant inventory and availability fluctuations hitting the market particularly hard right now, some of the current case prices may be from third parties or just generally overpriced.

The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects  Airflow on Kubernetes: Dynamic Workflows Simplified - Daniel Imberman, Bloomberg & Barni Seetharaman, Google   Apache Airflow is an open source workflow orchestration engine that allows users to write Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based workflows using a simple Python library. Airflow offers a wide range of native operators for services ranging from Spark and HBase to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Until recently, the Airflow user experience has been hindered by the need to launch and maintain statically-sized Celery-based Airflow clusters. These clusters were both expensive (over and under-utilization) and complex (multiple points of failure).  To address these issues, we developed and published a native Kubernetes Operator and Kubernetes Executor for Apache Airflow. These products allow one-step Airflow deployments, dynamic allocation of Airflow worker pods, full power over run-time environments, and per-task resource management.

Our objective is to compare gaming PC cases for best CPU and GPU temperatures, best noise-normalized temperatures and noise levels, best build quality, best features at a certain budget, and numerous other factors (like mechanical design quality) for 2021 so far. This includes some 2020 cases from late in 2020, as they're still on the market (clearly) and among the best. We've reviewed more cases in the last few months than ever in this period of the year before, so now is a good time to refresh our list of top cases. Of course, as more ship, we'll keep reviewing them. This round-up includes comparisons between cases like the Lian Li Lancool 215, the Meshify 2 (and Compact), be quiet! Silent Base 802, Corsair 4000D & 5000D, and more.  CASES FEATURED (in order of appearance)  NOTE: Some of these cases are way overpriced and sold by third-party sellers right now.

If you manage a lot of data, and you‚Äôre attending this summit, you likely rely on Apache Airflow to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Like any powerful tool, Apache Airflow allows you to accomplish what you couldn‚Äôt before‚Ä¶ but also creates new challenges. As DAGs pile up, complexity layers on top of complexity and it becomes hard to grasp how a failed or delayed DAG will affect everything downstream.

This is achieved by using AWS ECS Fargate and AWS RDS as the main components. The module is very resilient and easy to integrate in an existing infrastructure, providing a plethora of options such as HTTPS / RBAC / Executor Mode / Airflow Version / ‚Ä¶   Data Engineer Nicolas Gelders guides you through three main topics during his talk:   A comprehensive explanation of the Terraform Module and its most important options + a comparison with AWS MWAA The development of this module, including testing (gruntwork-io/terratest) Short demo of the Terraform module in action to deploy Airflow   Be sure to register and submit all possible questions!   In the meantime, check out all the reps on GitHub here: https://github.com/datarootsio/terraform-aws-ecs-airflow   Recordings of previous talks are available on the Dataroots Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKfMWrjJmeSdCBNsjZu3Jrw www.dataroots.io

Use case You have a data pipelines with 5 different tasks. The first task downloads data, 3 tasks train machine learning models, the last task chooses the best model. Each task training a machine learning model, produces an accuracy. According to this accuracy, you want to choose the best model in the last task. Question, how can you share the accuracies produced in the 3 training model tasks with the last task? XComs!  2. What is a XCom? XCom stands for cross communication and allows to share messages and small amount of data between tasks in data pipelines. A XCom is composed of a key (identifier), a value (must be serializable), a timestamp (when was created), an execution date (to which dagrun the XCom belongs with), a task id (which task created the XCom), a dag id (same as the task but for the dag). XComs are stored in the database of Airflow.  3. How to push a XCom 2 ways, with the return keywords or with xcom_push. Any value returned from an operator is automatically pushed as a XCom with the key return_value. With xcom_push you have to specify the key as well as the value. To use xcom_push, you have to access the task instance object corresponding to your task.  4. How to pull a XCom With xcom_pull. Again, to call xcom_pull, you have to access the task instance object of your task. xcom_pull expects two arguments, the key and a list of task ids.  5.

Amazon S3 is one of the oldest and most popular cloud storage offerings. Folks with data in S3 often want to use BigQuery to gain insights into their data. Using Apache Airflow, they can build pipelines to seamlessly orchestrate that connection. In this talk, Leah walks through how they created an easily configurable pipeline to extract data.

The wheels were ready to fall off this one, the wind up mechanism did not work, nor did the headlights and tail lights. It was missing the battery retainer otherwise was all there. This one fought me in numerous ways. When I stripped the old coating off the parts, the factory grille dissolved in a matter of seconds, evidently I should not have tried stripping the coating. I ordered a factory one for replacement when it comes in, however to make the video for this weekend I made a custom one just for now. The factory spring clip for the drive assembly snapped during reassembly and I had to improvise with a short spring and push clip. It worked well, however I was still saddened that It was not the correct parts, I will continue to look for a replacement clip to fix this correctly in the future. While reassembling, I missed installing the insulators under the light bulb contactors at first and had to remove and reinstall them after. Other than the slight mishaps, I am extremely thrilled with how this little car works. It drives well, and I love the clicking sound as you wind up the spring. The tail light is my favorite part of this hole car. Thank you for watching!  Want to send Chip Channel something? Restorable toys, tools, etc..

It'll be competing most directly with the Lian Li Lancool 215, Cooler Master TD500, Phanteks P400A, be quiet! Pure Base 500DX, and similar airflow cases. The new Corsair 4000D non-Airflow is also in for review, but unsurprisingly, it's not much of a performer. The 4000X is in for review at another time, assuming there's interest, but we're starting with both the 4000D and 4000D Airflow in this one. Some of the best cases for gaming PC builds right now are in this price class, so it's a good time for the case market.

However, sometimes manually writing DAGs isn't practical.   Maybe you have hundreds or thousands of DAGs that do similar things, with just a parameter changing between them. Or maybe you need a set of DAGs to load tables, but don't want to manually update DAGs every time those tables change. In these cases, and others, it can make more sense to dynamically generate DAGs. Because everything in Airflow is code, you can dynamically generate DAGs using Python alone.   In this webinar, we'll talk about when you might want to dynamically generate your DAGs, show a couple of methods for doing so, and discuss problems that can arise when implementing dynamic generation at scale.  In this webinar we cover: - How Airflow identifies a DAG - Use cases for dynamically generating DAGs - Commonly used methods for dynamic generation - Pitfalls and common issues with dynamic generation  Want to become an airflow expert?

I‚Äôll cover the basics of Airflow so you can start your Airflow journey on the right foot. This talk aims to answer questions such as: What is Airflow useful for? How do I get started? What do I need to know that‚Äôs not in the docs?  Airflow is a popular pipeline orchestration tool for Python that allows users to configure complex (or simple!) multi-system workflows that are executed in parallel across any number of workers. A single pipeline might contain bash, Python, and SQL operations. With dependencies specified between tasks, Airflow knows which ones it can run in parallel and which ones must run after others. Airflow is written in Python and users can add their own operators with custom functionality, doing anything Python can do.  Moving data through transformations and from one place to another is a big part of data science/engineering, but there are only two widely-used orchestration systems for doing so that are written in Python: Luigi and Airflow. We‚Äôve been using Airflow (http://pythonhosted.org/airflow/) for several months at Clover Health and have learned a lot about its strengths and weaknesses. We use it to run several pipelines multiple times per day. One includes over 450 heavily linked tasks!  www.pydata.org  PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.   PyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. 00:00 Welcome! 00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!

But let's not forget that your new baby needs to have good Airflow, bro. #CheapBuy Corsair 4000D Airflow - https://bit.ly/JomAirflow  With so many new components hitting the market, if you're like me, you're probably gearing up for an upgrade. And again, if you're anything like me and like some of that RGB goodness, your new PC is probably going to be sitting right smack on your desk.  So I was shopping around for a literal desktop PC Chassis that needed to tick most, if not all of these boxes. My ideal case would have to:  Support a full sized ATX motherboard. Cuz I need the connectivity options of a full ATX motherboard due to the nature of our work as content Creators. Mid tower. Preferably not too big. Because I need my desk space for my wacom tablet, full-sized keyboard, color grading panels and such. Good airflow because I'm going to try be recording video and audio around it quite often.  I think I have found just the right chassis.  Today we are going to review the Corsair 4000D Airflow TG ATX Case.

The goal of using Elyra is to help construct data pipelines by surfacing concepts and patterns common in pipeline construction into a familiar, easy to navigate interface for Data Scientists and Engineers so they can create pipelines on their own. In Elyra‚Äôs Pipeline Editor UI, portions of Apache Airflow‚Äôs domain language are surfaced to the user and either made transparent or understandable through the use of tooltips or helpful notes in the proper context during pipeline construction.

Ad: Buy Thermaltake Floe 360 on Amazon https://goo.gl/gPpZqx  Timestamps:  Golden Age of Computer Tech?  00:56 ‚Äì waffle: ‚ÄúAre we in the golden age of computer tech? Like, is this a "what a time to be alive" time? For all the complaining about memory and GPU prices, I get the vibe from content creators that there is some really neat tech worth being really excited over. So what do you think @Steve Burke? Maybe give us some general perspective on either how great or how not so great these times are?‚Äù  ‚ÄúDelidding‚Äù a GPU & Liquid Metal  06:37 ‚Äì delatroy: ‚ÄúHi steve. Like the 7700k/8700k, are there any meaningful thermal gains to be had by delidding a non-reference Nvidia 1080ti and replacing the TIM with liquid metal? Similarly, is it worth replacing the TIM between the heat spreader and heat sink? I love your cat! Thanks!‚Äù  When Do Reference Cards Suck?  10:12 ‚Äì Hakaru: ‚ÄúIv got a question (maybe one buildzoid could shed as me light on). You always say reference cards should be avoided, is that solely due to poor coolers or does the PCB also suck? After looking at various reference vrms they all seem overbuilt ( Vega and even the rx480 and 1080/70) so if I were to be replacing the cooler with an aftermarket one anyway would a reference card be advisable as it would save some money and help recoup the cost of the aftermarket cooler?‚Äù  Static Pressure vs. Airflow Fans  13:05 - Muahdib76: ‚ÄúQuestion for Ask GN. I'm looking to find out what type of case fan to use in certain parts of the case. I use a High Airflow fan for the back exhaust and High Static pressure fans for AIO's. Where the question comes is should I use a High Airflow fan{s} or High Static Pressure fan{s} for the the front intake or any intake that has a filter on it. What about a case that has a front intake with filter and about an inch of clearance from the front panel. I have 2 cases, the Corsair Carbide 600c and Fractal Meshify C. Fan recommendations? Thanks!‚Äù  AMD ‚ÄúLosing Marketshare‚Äù on Steam  18:32 ‚Äì davekorbiger: ‚ÄúHi! According to the Steam hardware survey AMD has lost 6% of marketshare last month and more than 10% since Ryzen was launched. AMD is now just above 10%! I think Intel's better IPC and the fresh released Coffee lake CPUs (especially the 6-core i5 and 4-core i3) are responsible for this. Considering that Ryzen was supposed to make AMD more relevant, do you think Ryzen 2 will change that?‚Äù  21:18 - Rjfleming82: ‚Äú@Steve Burke aisuite reports wattage consumed by CPU, using watts = current x voltage. I could derive current draw of CPU. Do u know if aisuite wattage is accurate?‚Äù  Will AIB Vega Cards Ever Exist?  23:04 ‚Äì Soupa: ‚Äú@Steve Burke #askgn-questions Any updates on AIB Vega cards? Seems like there are continued delays...‚Äù  AVX Offset Broken  24:16 ‚Äì Liquidpaper: ‚Äú@Steve Burke #askgn-questions I have a question concerning AVX offsets and Kaby Lake/Coffee Lake. Some people are reporting across multiple motherboards that AVX offsets don't always work on Kaby/Coffee lake platforms. @Sharkims and I both have this issue - the CPU clocks to whatever the AVX offset is, and that is it, regardless of AVX workload. I've done some digging and found that this problem exists regardless of Motherboard maufacturer -- ive seen this problem on ASRock, Gigabyte, ASUS, etc. Since you have far better connections than we do, do you think you could get an answer as to why this is happening?

Machine Learning models can add value and insight to many projects, but they can be challenging to put into production due to problems like lack of reproducibility, difficulty maintaining integrations, and sneaky data quality issues. Kedro, a framework for creating reproducible, maintainable, and modular data science code, and Great Expectations, a framework for data validations, are two great open-source Python tools that can address some of these problems. Both integrate seamlessly with Airflow for flexible and powerful ML pipeline orchestration.

Most that do well, though, still have a mesh panel somewhere. NZXT wants to prove that isn't necessary if using enough fans. Sponsor: EVGA X299 DARK w/ CLC 240 (https://geni.us/e10THI - use code GAMERSNEXUS)  Article: https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3521-nzxt-h710-case-review-brute-force-airflow NZXT H710 on Amazon: https://geni.us/8AX3y NZXT H700 on Amazon: https://geni.us/9mOvmF  The NZXT H710 case has been bouncing around in price a lot lately, and has continued to do so even after filming this review. Either way, it's a refresh of the existing NZXT H700 -- which we reviewed relatively positively -- and isn't a bad case on the whole. We'd advise against the "smart device" model still, but the physical hardware, barring any mangled software, is worthy of consideration in its price point. Today, we're benchmarking and reviewing the NZXT H710 vs. the H700 case, including thermal, acoustic, and noise normalized testing. We're also looking extensively at build quality and differences versus the H700 original case.  We have a new GN store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/  Like our content?

Find out right here: Remember, any heating or cooling system that uses a fan to distribute air is not only blowing air out, but ALWAYS pulling air back TOWARDS it. Your filter slot is almost always on this "return air" side (the "suckie" side, not the "blowie" side). So point the arrow in the same direction that air is moving past your filter slot. If you can't tell which way the air moves just by looking, then do the ol' lick-your-finger-and-hold-it-in-the-breeze test (just don't let anyone pull your finger during this test).  If your filter location is different than the one in this video (which it likely is) just remember that you want the arrow to point (say it with me) TOWARD YOUR FURNACE...or perhaps I should say toward the ductwork the air travels through to get back to your furnace. EXAMPLE: if your filter is located in a ceiling, but your furnace is down in the basement...don't literally point the arrow downward "at your furnace" (because it would be pointing at you, and I'm fairly confident that you are not a furnace), point it UPWARD toward the path the air needs to take through the ducts in order to get back to your furnace.  It is SOOOOOO important that you REPLACE YOUR FILTER REGULARLY! DO I LIKE ALL CAPS!? ABSOLUTELY!!! :)

Multi-tenant Airflow instances can help save costs for an organization. This talk will walk through how we dynamically assigned roles to users based on groups in Active Directory so that teams would have access to DAGs they created in the UI on our multi-tenant Airflow instance. We created our own custom AirflowSecurityManager class in order to achieve this that ultimately ties LDAP and RBAC together.

Sponsor: Get 10% off Squarespace purchases (https://geni.us/BqEpf)  Article: https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3511-phanteks-p400a-digital-rgb-case-review-airflow-mesh-panel-testing  Phanteks P400A RGB Black on Amazon: https://geni.us/M04PF Phanteks P400A RGB White on Amazon: https://geni.us/pzvgLzk Fractal Meshify C on Amazon: https://geni.us/YlS5o Cooler Master H500 on Amazon: https://geni.us/0PgbtOq  The Phanteks P400A follows-up the long-standing Eclipse P400. In this benchmarking, we look at the Phanteks P400A case's airflow and thermal performance (CPU & GPU temperature) through extensive testing. We also test acoustic performance for noise levels, noise-normalized thermals, and more. Our end comparisons primarily focus on the Phanteks P400A vs. the Cooler Master H500, NR600, SilverStone RL06, Thermaltake J24, and a couple others. For the Phanteks testing, we mostly benchmarked the white & black panels vs. the original P400 panel for thermal performance. Some testing shows thermal throttling for the original panel, unsurprisingly, and illustrates why choosing a good case is important. If the CPU or GPU is overheating in your case, there's a problem. The new variants are very successful in what they're trying to achieve -- watch the video to learn why!  Support us via the store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/  Like our content?

The car that I am doing the job on is a 2013 Subaru Legacy with a 2.5l four cylinder engine but this same process will work in any car with fuel injection.  In this video, we will first locate the sensor and then go through the process of removing the mass airflow sensor and cleaning it.  Symptoms of a dirty mass airflow sensor include rough idle, poor or jerky acceleration, and difficulty starting.  This is a job that anyone with some mechanical confidence can perform in their driveway.

Sponsor: Buy Gigabyte's X570 Master (Amazon - https://geni.us/WJgNK)  Article: https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3556-corsair-220t-airflow-case-review-benchmarks-thermals  Find Corsair's 220T Airflow on Amazon: https://geni.us/XaZHz6 Or the Phanteks P400A on Amazon: https://geni.us/YIZ3 Or Cooler Master's H500 on Amazon: https://geni.us/yUquA  The Corsair 220T has two variants: One has tempered glass, the other has "mesh," or what Corsair thinks equates "mesh." The biggest benefit of either, though, is that the truncated form factor gets the fans closer to the components, so airflow restrictions are less profoundly impacting as they are in cases where there's a drive's length of distance between the front of the case and the GPU. The Corsair 220T Airflow clearly markets itself on its cooling performance, and so we'll be validating those claims in our test bench.

As the Apache Airflow project grows, we seek both ways to incorporate rising technologies and novel ways to expose them to our users. Ray is one of the fastest-growing distributed computation systems on the market today. In this talk, we will introduce the Ray decorator and Ray backend. These features, built with the help of the Ray maintainers at Anyscale, will allow Data Scientists to natively integrate their distributed pandas, XGBoost, and TensorFlow jobs to their airflow pipelines with a single decorator. By merging the orchestration of Airflow and the distributed computation of Ray, this coordination of technologies opens Airflow users to a whole host of new possibilities when designing their pipelines.

He gave this presentation at the second annual HVACR Training Symposium. You can learn more about the 2022 HVACR Training Symposium at https://hvacrschool.com/symposium/.   While Manual J deals with residential load calculations, Manual S deals with residential equipment selection. The equipment‚Äôs goal should be to maintain 70 degrees in the winter and 75 degrees in the summer (with a 62-degree WB). These are not Manual J goals; they are goals of the entire residential design series (Manual J, Manual S, and Manual D).  When consulting codes, remember that those are MINIMUM standards. However, some of these codes refer to Manual J and Manual S, including IECC.  The sensible heat ratio (SHR) dictates the airflow you‚Äôll need (CFM per ton). The location and equipment manufacturer can affect the SHR, but they do not determine the CFM per ton alone. You must perform a load calculation to separate sensible BTUs from latent BTUs. Then, you divide your sensible BTUs by total BTUs to yield a ratio.  Your equipment performance data will determine blower performance. The manufacturer publishes these data sets, including heating performance data and expanded cooling performance data. (Expanded performance data can also tell you the WB, which is important in terms of meeting your design goals.) Follow that guidance for equipment selection (Manual S).  You may have heard of the 400 CFM per ton rule of thumb, but it‚Äôs about as accurate as ‚Äúbeer-can cold.‚Äù It‚Äôs just a rule of thumb, and your calculations will help you get a more precise CFM target for equipment selection.  It‚Äôs easier to determine capacity on a heating system, as all BTU/h are sensible. However, some cooling BTUs are latent, which complicates the capacity equation. Most manufacturers give you the total and sensible BTU/h, so you may have to do some math to determine the latent BTU/h for your SHR.  Sensible heat ratio (SHR) tells us how many BTU/h are sensible out of the total BTU/h. For example, if you have 10,000 BTU/h with an SHR of 0.75, that means that 7,500 BTU/h are sensible and 2,500 are latent. When your SHR is higher, your capacity increases. Both the system and the house have a sensible heat ratio.  When determining the CFM per ton with SHR, you can use your temperature difference (TD) in that equation. Manual S has a chart that tells you the TD for a given SHR. In that equation, you divide your sensible BTU/h by the product of 1.1 and your TD. You may get a number that‚Äôs far higher than 400 CFM per ton! Once you figure out your CFM, you can size your equipment based on airflow, capacity, and oversizing guidelines. Remove any equipment that is short on capacity from consideration.  Manual S has 3 ‚ÄúN‚Äù sections, which refer to standards. N1 deals with definitions and general requirements, N2 deals with sizing limits, and N3 deals with OEM verification.  N1 emphasizes the importance of using OEM performance data. Do NOT use the AHRI equipment performance data for sizing. While AHRI‚Äôs figures are good for getting a general idea, no data can compare to the manufacturer‚Äôs expanded performance data when it comes to accuracy.  One of the most important tables in Manual S is Table N2-1 in section N2-5. It tells you how to select air conditioners for single-speed, two-speed, and variable-speed equipment. The table also gives you the minimum and maximum sizing ranges for air-to-air systems as a ratio, typically with a 0.9 minimum (90%) to 1.15-1.3 (115-130%). The same table for heat pumps is in section N2-6 (Table N2-2).  When adding a dehumidifier, keep in mind that the sizing value is based on 85% of the latent cooling load. When making conversions to pints per hour, you take the latent BTU/h and divide it by 1,054.  Overall, you must remember that Manual S says to meet the sensible and latent heat gains, but don‚Äôt exceed the total gain by 15% (single speed), 20% (two speed), or 30% (variable speed).  On the heating side, you need to be able to counter the sensible losses in the heat. If a heating system cannot put out enough BTU/h to exceed those losses, you may need to add another source of supplemental heat and recalculate the BTU/h output to see if it exceeds the losses. If the BTU/h in sensible gain exceeds the losses, then the system will run satisfactorily for most of the winter.  To find the heating load CFM, you take the furnace sensible output (BTU/h) and divide it by the product of 1.1 and the temperature rise (instead of TD in cooling systems).  Ed also covers:  Design software programs Interpolation Default TD values for CFM approximations Sizing for budget systems House SHR and leaky homes Sensible losses in the winter Modern furnace sizing  Read all the tech tips, take the quizzes, and find our handy calculators at https://www.hvacrschool.com/.

This is a common problem since most home are built with very minimal air balancing options such as dampers and hvac zoning systems.  In this video we show several easy ways to increase air flow in the house and improve poor airflow upstairs.  Starting with the basics, you can simply adjust dampers throughout your house to manipulate the air flow to get it to go where you want.  You can also adjust your dampers that are typically near your furnace.  These usually will close off upstairs or downstairs, however you are still using the same thermostat to control the temperature in both upstairs and downstairs.  The best option for how to cool the upstairs of a 2 story house is to install a zoning system to balance the air in your home.    You can create many zones with independent thermostats throughout your house that will have you never asking why upstairs is hot again!  Another easy solution if your upstairs is hot is to turn on your blower motor and run it continuously.  This will just run the fan to keep air circulating throughout your house.

I thought I'd take a deep look at exactly WHAT it is that makes this such a strong performer in the air-flow department. It's a combination of factors, each engineered out well. Open fans with little to no obstruction, a well-designed swale to direct airflow over the motherboard. thicker fans that can move and push more air, well-designed compartments to reduce air leaving the case only to be pulled back in again. I expect this case to become the standard for high-airflow cases.    Samsung Magician software official site https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor...

Sponsor: Buy Be Quiet!'s Straight Power 11 PSUs (Amazon - https://geni.us/YVeZ)  Find the Corsair 465X iCUE RGB on Amazon: https://geni.us/fBFoW9 Alternative: NZXT H700 (Amazon): https://geni.us/syWoFC Alternative: Cooler Master H500P Mesh (Amazon): https://geni.us/L5g2a  Article (goes live 5 minutes after video): https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3515-corsair-icue-465x-rgb-case-review  This review of the Corsair 465X case looks at build quality, thermals, noise, and ease-of-installation features, with a focus on testing whether the front spacing for the glass panel is actually effective. The case itself is a rehash of the Corsair 460X, and should be priced at about $150-$160. Pricing is partly impacted by tariffs and partly by the glass and LEDs, which unfortunately inflate MSRP beyond what the chassis really feels worth.

Ingeniously and generously featured, it‚Äôs still a very light unit, making it the ideal companion for your outdoor trips. It‚Äôs equally at ease on walks and fast hikes, but also does a great job on bike and climbing excursions.

Its biggest downside is a lack of included fans, but we tested with additional fans and our standardized fan suite to determine the efficacy of the mesh panel on the new case. This is a follow-up to the slightly larger and more expensive P400A, which we awarded Best Airflow and Best Overall for 2019. The P300A vs. NR600, Fractal Meshify C, and other case comparisons are also made in this review.  Like our content?

Our benchmarks of the NR600 case look at thermals, noise, and the benefit of adding one fan. We also test with 2x 140mm fans instead, finding interesting results as an outcome of an oversight with the case design. This case's very fine mesh is a big reason for its performance.

We also have a lot of source systems that display and make these metrics accessible to end users. So what happens when your data model does not match your system? For example your bookings numbers in salesforce do not match your data model that curates bookings metrics.

But is that a good idea?   I previously did a video on how to mount your GPU vertically in the 4000D Airflow (https://youtu.be/PMr3alCeM78) but in that case I had a front mounted 360mm all in one cooler, so there was a question of whether that was negatively impacting airflow and thus partly to blame for the poor vertical mounting results.   This time, I'm running the 5000D with 6 fans up front pulling air in and 6 more on top exhausting air out with a push/pull config to keep it running nicely. So will the results be superior?  For reference, the parts used here: MSI RTX 3080 Suprim - https://youtu.be/5pwB_8s8GAo Corsair 5000D Airflow https://youtu.be/L2ervXeVk0o Corsair H150i Elite Cappelix - https://youtu.be/VYgWCVMOQfE Corsair extension lead - https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/PC-Components/Power-Supplies/Premium-PCIe-3-0-x16-Extension-Cable-300mm/p/CC-8900243  US link https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/PC-Components/Power-Supplies/Premium-PCIe-3-0-x16-Extension-Cable-300mm/p/CC-8900419  If you're interested, the spec of this build is as follows: Motherboard - MSI Meg Z490 Godlike CPU - Intel Core i9-10900K RAM - Corsair Dominator DDR4 64GB RGB 3466Mhz https://youtu.be/HDQhxH6ALQs M.2 NVMe drives - Samsung 970 Evo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzTLXOPrT7Y M.2 NVMe drives - WD_Black SN750 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIrIPviU96w SSD - Samsung Evo 860 Pro SSD 1TB PSU - Corsair RM850x 850 watt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxW6yFZavS8 GPU - MSI RTX 3080 Suprim  Vertical GPU mounting - how to, why and should you?

Engineering teams leverage the factory coding pattern to write easy-to-read and repeatable code. In this talk, we‚Äôll outline how data engineering teams can do the same with Airflow by separating DAG declarations from business logic, abstracting task declarations from task dependencies, and creating a code architecture that is simple to understand for new team members. This approach will set analytics teams up for success as team and Airflow DAG sizes grow exponentially.
1423	FOX 5 New York	New airflow study shows how to prevent COVID spread inside a vehicle	0	2020-12-09	myfoxnyfox5ny	3624	27	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/M71ExWA5V7s/maxresdefault.webp	1280	720	News & Politics		https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIjSUWHWp6KohfnR5OQTXnQ	NEW YORK - A new study looking at how airflow inside a vehicle impacts the risk of getting COVID-19 may help keep people healthier.  With many New Yorkers opting for taxis or other ride-sharing services instead of mass transit during the pandemic, it's become difficult to socially distance when operating or riding in a vehicle.  So researchers from Brown University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst developed a computer simulation to learn how air flows in a confined space, like a car.  ‚ÄúIt showed us that you don‚Äôt necessarily need to open all the windows,‚Äù said Varghese Mathai, a professor of physics who worked on the study.  The worst thing to do is to keep the windows up and put the heat or air conditioning on full blast.  Having the passenger sitting in the backseat with all four windows down is ideal, but not the only safe option. You can create the right amount of airflow when one window is open in the back and another in the front, specifically, the front passenger side window and the window behind the driver. When the car is moving, this causes the air to flow in from the back and out the front, limiting cross-contamination within the vehicle.  "You are going on a diagonal through the car and there‚Äôs a strong wind between the occupants,‚Äù said Mathai.  He adds that this can create an air curtain between the driver and passenger.   ‚ÄúThis gust of air serves as an air barrier between two occupants."

Two 120mm AirGuide fans, one on the front for intake and one on the rear for exhaust. On its official site, Corsair claims that these two fans are enough to run your PC on. Seems mad. Can't possibly be true surely?  When I first setup the Corsair 5000D Airflow, I used 12 fans - multiple front intake fans with ML120 Pro RGBs then six more as exhaust over the AIO. https://youtu.be/L2ervXeVk0o  I have now uninstalled most of that with the exception of three fans on the AIO to see how it performed. The results are actually really surprising.

Which suuuuuuucks.   But I ran benchmarks on both and played games in both setups to see how it performed.  Benchmarks:  12 fans: PC Mark - https://www.3dmark.com/pcm10/56995805?

In this talk, we present Viewflow, an open-source Airflow-based framework that allows data scientists to create materialized views in SQL, R, and Python without writing Airflow code. We will start by explaining what problem does Viewflow solve: writing and maintaining complex Airflow code instead of focusing on data science. Then we will see how Viewflow solves that problem. We will continue by showing how to use VIewflow with several real-world examples.

This was a simple install that should take you less than 30 minutes and there are claims out there that you can see up to a 30% increase in how much air comes through your vents. This is a critical upgrade if you live in a warm weather climate!  Something we didn‚Äôt expect is the reduction of noise that the unit makes when it runs now. Apparently, most of the sound inside the RV is the air pulling into the return. We measured, unofficially, and decrease of about 3-4 decibels but it seems more dramatic than that. It‚Äôs noticeably quieter. It is also possible that these units make your AC unit operate more efficiently which will use less energy.  The RV Airflow System is made from hard styrofoam, so it‚Äôs best to not force these into your AC opening. With the right angle and amount of force, they slide in place nicely.  #GDRV4Life #RVLiving #FullTimeRV   üì∂ Need a complete, reliable internet system?

The car was built in 1936, although it looks like it took design cues from the 1940s. Despite many qualities, the Airflow turns out to be a financial flop for Chrysler, but it ultimately inspired and pioneered progress in the US car manufacturing industry.  #AirflowCR50 #Chrysler #Motorvision  TRY US FOR FREE ON AMAZON CHANNELS Click this link and find out more about our new streaming service on Amazon Channels with exclusive shows!

Sponsor: Linode Hosting - get $100 credit with GN (https://geni.us/UaKrUmF)  Please consider supporting this type of unique testing work by grabbing a toolkit, mouse mat, bar runner, or shirt from our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/ - thanks to our Patreon backers and store customers for making it possible to buy testing equipment like this!  Watch our PlayStation 5 thermal testing from previously: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmggkW6usmQ Xbox Series X thermals got done today and is being edited/rendered/QC'd, then will go up. Watch our original RTX 3080 FE Schlieren photography video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVaGRtX80gI  Schlieren photography is useful for visualizing air patterns and movement when the air density has a gradient -- or a change in density -- surrounding a product. This isn't a perfect testing method and doesn't tell us thermal performance (we use thermocouples for that, and the Series X thermals will be uploaded in a few days), but it does tell us how the air exits the consoles, how obstructed it might be, and what directions it takes. This also allows us to the opportunity to closer analyze the console's internal heatsink design: Even though we can't see the heatsink with this imaging, we can see how the air exits the device and at what angle, and speed, and all of these factors allow us to better understand the finstack impedance and angles. The Sony PlayStation 5 already had thermal testing in one of our previous pieces, with the Xbox Series X thermals coming up soon.  Like our content?

I got them from the RVAirflow document here: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0416/2863/1202/files/INSTRUCTION_SHEET_M3.pdf?v=1609361649 It cites Coleman manufacturing as the source‚Ä¶   However, looking at https://www.airxcel.com/DesktopModules/RVProduct/Pdf/1976c520.pdf it just says, "Proper tension has been achieved for each bolt when any portion of each gasket indicating tab has been pulled down even with the roof. See Figure 4. The upper unit has now been properly installed with optimum gasket compression.‚Äù Our take: Use your best judgement.  If the torque value seems too high, revert to the instructions from AirXCel.

Which will be more efficient or simple for your use case? In this practical session, we will discuss the differences, nuances, and benefits of both solutions, giving practical differentiators between those 2, and example use-cases that leverage the distinct features of the orchestration engines. A demo will be a part of the session - we will implement the same orchestration flow on both engines to compare the implementation side by side.

I have been using Givi and Puig Windscreens for quite some time.  The Screen performs great on and off road.  The Review is not paid by anyone it is my observations only.  After having this screen for a while I can recommend it for anyone that wants to upgrade from the OEM.    The AIRFLOW is the most versatile Givi windshield to date.  The adjustable spoiler allows the rider on the fly to easily and quickly make adjustments. Made of transparent polycarbonate, the adjustable spoiler is infinitely adjustable along the 4.75" (12cm) of travel. Once the desired setting has been selected a simple and secure clamp will keep it in place.  The design of the AIRFLOW system creates an aerodynamic effect that eliminates turbulence, allowing for maximum protection from wind thus reducing rider fatigue.  Another important feature is the ability to reduce AIRFLOW to the rider to increase driving safety while raining: the "spoiler effect" reduces and, can at times, eliminate rain from collecting on the visor and reducing vision. During the warmer days the AIRFLOW spoiler, can easily be removed allowing travel with only the lower part of the windshield as well.

Fans of these two predecessors may be interested in the Meshify. Ad: Buy EVGA's CLC 280 (Amazon) - https://geni.us/7cF3  Fractal has been Meshify-ing its cases for a few years now, starting with the Meshify C. The S2 is the next to receive this treatment, seeing slight upscaling on the front panel of the Meshify C and some foam changes, but otherwise benefiting from the same panel design. The Meshify S2 most directly competes (in price) with the H500P Mesh, NZXT H700, Fractal's own R6, and similar cases.

Let‚Äôs find out One other factor that I forgot to mention in the review, that the throat hit is more noticeable with the new airflow system due to the air velocity is directly aimed at the coil.  AEROKON Airflow Control The AEROKON Airflow Control is the first system for MTL tank atomizers that restricts the airflow directly underneath the coil rather than at the air inlet. This leads prevent the airflow being accelerated and distributed more evenly around the coil. The result is: Better performance for MTL setups  More flavour (not very noticeable but better throat hit)  Optimized vapor saturation Sealed 510 connector (the rim around the pin is the 510 connector NOT the pin) Airflow: continuously   product category: Modification  Airflow Control: internal (continuously adjustable between 0mm ‚Äì 1.2mm on the Pro up to 1.8mm) Material: NBR-70

Previewed by a concept that looks fairly close to reality, it‚Äôs an attractively styled compact crossover that will likely ride on a new EV platform from Chrysler‚Äôs parent company, Stellantis, called STLA Medium. Based on preliminary figures the company has released about its new battery technologies, the Airflow could achieve a driving range of up to 440 miles. The Airflow could arrive as soon as 2024 as a 2025 model and will serve as a rival to the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Tesla Model Y, the Volvo XC40 Recharge, and other electric SUVs.  The Chrysler Airflow will be an all-new model from Stellantis, part of the automaker‚Äôs expansive EV product plan. The company has already trademarked the Airflow name, which has ties to a historic Chrysler model from the 1930s.  2025 Chrysler Airflow, 2025 Chrysler Airflow EV, 2025 Chrysler Airflow interior, 2025 Chrysler Airflow exterior, 2025 Chrysler Airflow specs, 2025 Chrysler Airflow review, new 2025 Chrysler Airflow, Chrysler Airflow 2025  new Chrysler Airflow.  ================================================================== All scene of this video form creative common ( CC) Youtube licence.

Rather then forever pulling out and swapping fans I have made up a basic airflow simulation showing the current setup I run on my Corsair 600T PC case. I will also show the top mount "intake" setup in a separate video for comparison. This is not scientific just an approximation.

It's not quite in the ultra-budget category, but it's cheaper than the competing Lancool 215, P400A, et al. Sponsor: EVGA Z20 Keyboard on Amazon https://geni.us/kvPqEC  Watch our Best Cases of 2021 (So Far) round-up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffuAnwGivO8 You can see our review of the Phanteks P300A here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L9YfbCirTg  Phanteks made the P360A slightly larger than the P300A and, more importantly, Phanteks added a second fan that the P300A really needed. In this review we‚Äôll look at how those changes compare the P360A to other Phanteks cases -- like the P300A and the P400A -- and to competing cases from other manufacturers. The budget airflow case category has become popular in the last few years (you‚Äôre welcome), and the likes of the Lancool 215, Fractal Design Meshify 2 Compact (at the high-end), P360A, Fara R1, and other cases have brought options across the PC case stack. If you‚Äôre looking for a cheaper airflow-focused case, the Phanteks P360A should likely be on the radar -- and our testing will benchmark whether it‚Äôs worth it compared to alternatives. Looking for the best budget airflow case for a gaming PC is a lot easier with a market this packed.

This means air is flowing into the case and hot air from the CPU and GPU / Video card is flowing out. This is important to regulate the temperature of the CPU and GPU / Video Card to ensure it's operating efficiently.   Part 2 Video ( Negative vs Neutral Air Flow | Temperature difference) https://youtu.be/jl10lb8XF0Y  When I initially installed the cooling fans, I made a mistake and had to reconfigure them. Don't make the same mistake I did.  Some fans have markings on them to indicate which way the air flow moves through the blades.

The company then brought a revision to CES, and since CES, has made even further revisions to increase hole density in the mesh of the Lancool II case update.

Today we are installing a Ram airflow air intake system on this 2020 Ram 1500 equipped with a 5.7L V8. Very easy install with instructions that go step by step. The instructions tell you what tools you need to complete this job. The kit includes your hardware, a hose and a clamp, two brackets and a small cover.

This is where an open air design can help because it lets more air flow through the system which means better performance overall. Today I'm going to break down some of my favorite cases for different budgets so you can find one for yourself on any budget! How to choose best airflow pc case buying guide  What is the best airflow case for PC gaming? That's a question many gamers ask themselves when they are looking at buying a new computer. There are so many different cases out there and it can be hard to figure out which one will work best for you. The answer really depends on what kind of games you play, how often you game, and what your budget is like. If you love playing high-end graphics games then having great ventilation is key to keeping your expensive computer cool so that it doesn't overheat while running these demanding programs. But if all you do is browse the web or watch movies on Netflix then air circulation isn't as important because those programs run much more smoothly than some 3D games with heavy graphics requirements.                                       -------------------------------------------  We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.                                        -------------------------------------------                                         COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER:  If you own any of the content in my video and you don't want it appear in my channel, please notify me via private message or email.

"Message from the speaker: Airflow is a great product. I would like to use it in my personal and business projects a lot, but it is a complex service to manage. The managed services at the moment are too pricy for smaller scale projects. Could you please fill out the form at this link https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdueJyQIMl9bJ8oBbWLK7rKXNUEW6Ar0_1s0YOw2vYwUOGgsw/viewform and let me know what you think of this issue.

This handheld device allows mobility in large areas or remote locations where a direct connection to power is not practical.  For critical containment areas where the pattern of airflow is important, the ¬∞C Breeze PlanarFlow Nozzle Accessory is perfect for planar face velocity testing.  Dispersing fog uniformly, the PlanarFlow design makes it perfect for visualizing airflow patterns in containment cabinets.

This handheld device allows mobility in large areas or remote locations where a direct connection to power is not practical.  For critical containment areas where reduced flow velocity is needed for airflow profile visualization, the ¬∞C Breeze FlowBulb Nozzle is the perfect accessory.  The FlowBulb accessory slows fog velocity and reduces volume for enhanced flow visualization of delicate airflow profiles. This allows you to easily discover airflow patterns in USP 797 testing.

In this video I wanted to have a conversation around mobile homes and what we as experienced HVAC technicians see and hear from our mobile homeowners when it comes to staying comfortable in their homes.  Is your mobile home AC not working? Is your mobile home heater not warm?  These are signs that you might need a mobile home hvac replacement.  There are mobile home furnaces and air conditioners for mobile homes. Coleman and Intertherm are the most popular mobile home and trailer home hvac systems.  While they are pretty straightforward in the removal and replacement of the system, there are some essential parts of the job that just can‚Äôt be messed up: ‚Ä¢ The sheet metal transition back to the existing ductwork. ‚Ä¢ The condensate drainage still requires a p-trap even though the evap coil is sitting level with the floor. ‚Ä¢ The gas piping needs a gas sediment trap that meets the new building code standard (CA Plumbing Code 1212.8) ‚Ä¢ The exhaust needs a proper flue connection to the roofline and into the atmosphere. ‚Ä¢ Coleman and Intertherm evaporator coils don‚Äôt come with a thermal expansion valve already connected.  They need to be field installed by the technician. ‚Ä¢ High and low-voltage connections need to be made safely.  The Biggest Issue We Hear from Mobile Home Owners:  Airflow  Why is airflow a problem in mobile homes? I'm going to talk about the layout of the ductwork and why airflow seems to be such an issue in a mobile home and trailer home.  Whether it be a single-wide or double-wide mobile home the air seems to not reach all of the rooms the same.  And this is what I talk about.  #hvac #sacramento #mobile homes #trailer homes  Please visit our website @ http://www.foxfamilyhvac.com  If you'd like to book an appointment with Fox Family Heating and Air in Sacramento, El Dorado, or Placer County, CA  https://book.housecallpro.com/book/Fox-Family-Heating-and-Air-Conditioning/babd3396dba440e1afac01c631d95f1d  Visit us on our social media pages: Facebook @ https://www.facebook.com/FoxFamilyHeatingAirConditioning Twitter @ https://twitter.com/foxfamilyhvac LinkedIn @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-fox-46ab48110/ Tumblr @ http://foxfamilyhvac.tumblr.com/  00:00 Intro 0:26 Two Brands of HVAC Systems 0:54 Essential Parts of an HVAC Replacement 2:03 Airflow is the Biggest Issues We Hear 3:42 Can the Airflow Be Fixed?

1579	Curtis In Seattle	Ravelli Francesca pellet stove airflow sensor error, cleaning, hopper filling and burn pot cracks	0	2021-12-04	raindancernw	70	2	https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/-LamIo-Ev4s/maxresdefault.webp	1920	1080	Autos & Vehicles	VNVideoEditor	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyo6BASnJuLNit0Q0rbJwaw	Purchased new in December 2017 my Revelli pellet stove has run for 4500 hours.  I've had a few issues, which I discuss along with cleaning and how I fill it.  I discuss and show the old, cracked burn pot and a discussion of the 09 Air Flow Sensor error, where the sensor is and how to change it.  I call the Flame Trap a fire box baffle amongst other incorrect terminology SORRY!!   Generally, I like the stove, it is efficient and I only burn about 65 bags for a season in the Seattle area to heat about 900 to 1000 sqft.  When they installed the stove, they DID NOT run the RDS set up and the tech threw in a hand full of pellets instead of priming the auger by using the display buttons. As a result of not running the RDS set up, I had many failed start-ups and a few flame outs too in the next several weeks.  After "Flame Light", the 8-minute warm up cycle would spew all the pellets out of the burn pot "popcorn" they call it.  After several Google searches, I was able to find a power point tech training presentation, the RDS codes, flow diagram of what the parameters mean and when they are active.  Through a lot of trial and error and running the RDS set up, my stove starts every time and never flames out.  I won't be giving the secret codes out - SORRY!!  However, I encourage you to search online.  Over time I have found new info and some of the old info is no longer found.  Maybe Ravelli complains and things get taken down?  Thanks!

I get there and I think it‚Äôs kind of odd I feel some heat coming out of the inducer. I looked inside the unit and units not starting out. I check the pressure switch is closed. Then unit fires up runs alittle while and goes out. The limit shuts the gas off and blower not starting up. I find the wire going to the capacitor for the blower motor was disconnected and against the blower housing. I replaced the wire connection. The blower motor still wouldn‚Äôt start. The motor was really hot and off on overload. Therefore I have it time to cool off. After the motor cooled off the unit fired up and the blower started right up. A repair job where no parts needing to be replaced. My favorite kind of repairs

It is rubbed by the air flow in the tube, and then ejected from the tube.

1598	The Wheel Network	Stellantis Software Day Press Conference	0	2021-12-07	rtwingo	2030	43	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBZKpdpeZvc/maxresdefault.jpg	1920	1080	Autos & Vehicles		https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyRZN8YfhA1KjJaE5kaZUQ	Stellantis mapped out its software strategy to deploy next-generation tech platforms, building on existing connected vehicle capabilities to transform how customers interact with their vehicles, and to generate approximately ‚Ç¨20 billion in incremental annual revenues by 2030.  This transformation will move Stellantis‚Äô vehicles from today‚Äôs dedicated electronic architectures to an open software-defined platform that seamlessly integrates with customers‚Äô digital lives. It greatly expands the options customers have to add innovative features and services via regular over-the-air (OTA) updates.  Stellantis plans to invest more than ‚Ç¨30 billion through 2025 to execute its software and electrification transformation.  The Stellantis software strategy works hand-in-hand with the company‚Äôs vehicle electrification plans, detailed at EV Day in July 2021, which targets that more than 70% of its vehicle sales in Europe and more than 40% of vehicle sales in the United States will be low-emission vehicles (LEV) by 2030. Each of the company‚Äôs 14 iconic brands is committed to offering best-in-class, fully electrified solutions.  Foxconn In addition to the closing of Mobile Drive, planned for December 31, 2021, the new non-binding memorandum of understanding signed with Foxconn aims at designing a family of purpose-built micro-controllers to support Stellantis and third-party customers. The partnership is intended to develop four families of chips that will cover more than 80% of the company‚Äôs micro-controllers‚Äô needs, helping to greatly simplify the supply chain. Adoption and installation of products into Stellantis vehicles is targeted by 2024.  Waymo Stellantis also continues its dedicated projects with Waymo. As Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids equipped with the Waymo Driver provide thousands of fully autonomous rides in Phoenix, Arizona (USA), Stellantis and Waymo have now expanded their partnership to local delivery services. Building on Stellantis‚Äô leadership in light commercial vehicles and investment in electrification, the partners are collaborating on work streams focused on commercial development. Engineering teams will get their hands on Stellantis prototypes in 2022.  Fast-growing, Software-enabled Business Stellantis will grow its software and connected services business through five key pillars: ‚ñ™ Services and subscriptions ‚ñ™ Features on demand ‚ñ™ Data as a service and fleet services ‚ñ™ Vehicle pricing and resale value ‚ñ™ Conquests, service retention and cross-selling  Today, Stellantis has 12 million monetizable connected cars globally. By 2026, this is expected to grow to 26 million vehicles and generate approximately ‚Ç¨4 billion in revenues and, by 2030, it will reach 34 million vehicles and approximately ‚Ç¨20 billion in annual revenues. Monetizable is defined as the vehicle‚Äôs first 5 years of life.  Leveraging its data collection capabilities, in 2022, Stellantis will launch a usage-based insurance program offered through the captive finance arms in Europe and North America, with the intent to expand globally.  Coming in 2024 Launching in 2024, the three new platforms will be deployed, at scale, across the four vehicle platforms of Stellantis over the following two years.  The heart of the transformation to customer-centric services is the new electrical/electronic (E/E) and software architecture, STLA Brain.  STLA Brain is fully OTA capable, with 30 modules addressed, versus 10 today, making it highly flexible. It is a service-oriented architecture fully integrated with the cloud that connects electronic control units within the vehicle with the vehicle‚Äôs central high-performing computer (HPC) via a high-speed data bus. It breaks today‚Äôs bond between hardware and software generations, enabling software developers to create and update features and services quickly without waiting for a new hardware launch. These OTA updates dramatically reduce costs for both the customers and Stellantis, simplify maintenance for the user and sustain vehicle residual values.  STLA SmartCockpit, built on top of STLA Brain, will seamlessly integrate with the digital lives of vehicle occupants to create a customizable third living space. Studies show that customers spend an average of four years of their lives in their vehicles and this is only increasing.  STLA SmartCockpit, powered by the Mobile Drive joint venture between Stellantis and Foxconn, delivers AI-based applications, such as navigation, voice assistance, e-commerce marketplace and payment services.  STLA AutoDrive, developed in partnership with BMW, will offer Level 2, Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities and will be continuously upgraded through OTA updates.  ___  Video Timeline 0:00 ‚Äì Chapter I: Opening Remarks 6:15 ‚Äì Chapter II: Software as a Growth Story 19:07 ‚Äì Chapter III: Technology Plan, Digital Cockpit 31:00 ‚Äì Chapter IV: Capabilities Roadmap, Airflow, Conversation with CTO 45:29 ‚Äì Chapter V: Financial Review 52:25 ‚Äì Chapter VI: Closing Remarks

The compressed air stream clings to the coanda profile as it enters the inside walls of the amplifier and thereby creating a vacuum that induces the outside air at point (B) converting the pressure into amplified airflow.  The amplified  of airflow leaves at the exit at point (C).   Airflow is further amplified downstream at point (D) by entraining additional air from the surroundings at the exit.

When air moves faster, the pressure of the air decreases. So the pressure on the top of the wing is less than the pressure on the bottom of the wing. The difference in pressure creates a force on the wing that lifts the wing up into the air.

The world‚Äôs leading technology in air filtration, neutralisation, and decontamination has been professionally installed in Komedia Brighton's venue spaces. Radic8 is a state-of-the-art filtration system which destroy viruses, bacteria, VOC‚Äôs and purifies the air rapidly and effectively.  Radic8's state-of-the-art UV-filtration system removes viruses, bacteria, VOC‚Äôs and purifies the air rapidly and effectively. Successfully tested against Coronavirus, Adenovirus, Influenzavirus, Sars and Poliovirus.   Radic8 takes control of the airflow in a room. The units are designed to draw exhaled air down to the floor, and then towards the intake of the unit. The contaminated air is then filtered and sterilised, before being sent back into the breathing area of the room.  This creates a persistent, laminar airflow that is constantly pulling contaminated air away from the breathing area, and replacing it with clean, fresh air.

On our 4.8 we installed a 220/224 camshaft, headers, and a ton of other parts that affect how it will run, and so it needs to be tuned in order to let the engine run properly. I have tuned a few trucks myself, but certainly do not consider myself an expert, but luckily I do know a few professional tuners. In this episode, we start the tuning process, learn a few lessons, and ultimately consult a professional to get this baby 4.8 dialed in and ready to hit the dyno.

Le syst√®me ¬´ IAFO ¬ª (Internal Air Flow Optimizer) utilise une buse √©tudi√©e sur le plan a√©rodynamique qui canalise et acc√©l√®re le flux d'air d√®s sa sortie des centrales de soufflage lorsqu'il est √† pleine puissance. Il est ensuite redress√© par un conduit central pour transmettre la quasi-totalit√© de la vitesse du flux initiale. D√®s lors, le flux puissamment vectoris√© b√©n√©ficie d'une vitesse d'√©jection tr√®s √©lev√©e qu'il est indispensable de pr√©server le plus longtemps possible. C'est l√† qu'interviennent les guides d'air ouverts du syst√®me IAFO, en forme de virgule, qui canalisent le flux sans perte de charge. Ce concept aux antipodes de tout ce qui a pu √™tre r√©alis√© jusqu'√† ce jour est le fruit d'une simulation ultra-pr√©cise et r√©aliste totalement in√©dite. Cette √©tude initi√©e par Lamberet combine des mesures r√©elles √† une mod√©lisation par √©l√©ments finis comprenant une structure t√©tra√©drique de  4 512 000 cellules!  Le syst√®me IAFO garantit ainsi un √©coulement d'air froid jusqu'√† l'extr√©mit√© arri√®re de la zone chargement et favorise le retour d'air par le bas. Cette action homog√©n√©ise les temp√©ratures quelque soit la position du chargement. Le principal b√©n√©fice r√©side dans la qualit√© de la r√©frig√©ration de la semi et donc la fiabilisation des points de consigne de temp√©rature dont le non respect est √† l'origine de nombreux contentieux d√©coulant du refus des marchandises livr√©es. Par ailleurs  gr√¢ce √† cette plus grande efficacit√© la consommation du groupe frigorifique dont le  cycle de fonctionnement est totalement modifi√© peut baisser de pr√®s de 3%.  Erick M√©jean : ¬´ Nous avons √©t√© tr√®s surpris du r√©sultat de nos recherches. D√®s le d√©but nos mod√©lisation nous emmenaient √† l'oppos√© de ce que nous comptions initialement faire et qui √©tait proche du standard actuel. Une premi√®re certitude d√©coule de nos travaux, √† savoir que les gaines conduits et panneaux de recyclage d'air aujourd'hui en vigueur dans la profession et que nous utilisions en toute bonne foi, impactent en r√©alit√© de mani√®re extr√™mement n√©gative le fonctionnement du groupe froid. Ce sont donc l'efficacit√© et la fiabilit√© du refroidissement qui sont mis a mal  des la sortie du groupe de refroidissement. Notre mod√©lisation le d√©montre sans aucune ambigu√Øt√©. La vitesse mesur√©e du flux d'air ainsi que le volume d'air recycl√© √† l'arri√®re du v√©hicule √©quip√©e du syt√®me IAFO ont plus que doubl√©. Notre  innovation vise clairement √† √©liminer ou minimiser les refus de marchandises pour non-respect du point de consigne, ph√©nom√®ne en constante augmentation ces derni√®res ann√©es qui impacte tr√®s durement les transporteurs. C'est √©galement une r√©ponse  d'une n√©cessit√© absolue d√©coulant du transport de produits pharmaceutiques dont la valeur assur√©e peut atteindre pr√®s de 30 millions d'Euros par semi remorque. La puissance du flux d'air du syst√®me IAFO permet une homog√©n√©isation rapide des temp√©ratures au sein de la caisse en √©liminant le ¬´ point chaud ¬ª et le ph√©nom√®ne de double flux qui se formait habituellement et ce quel que soit le chargement. ¬ª

Today I would like to share with you a video regarding unboxing my first ever spray booth. I have read and heard a lot of positive feedback, my favourite one was that this tool is a really must have for every one, begginers and pros! I have painted my projects outside so this device would help me to finalize some of them despite the short day and cold. So let's see what is in this box!  There is a turn table which rotates smoothly, instruction manual with pictures, 12V 5 Amps and 60 Watts power supply, an air hose that you can put out of the window, a top led tube and the main product. Once you get it out of the box there are some additional parts hidden inside like a pipe coupling, some side led tubes, another air hose and a clamp hose. In order to assembly this booth you have to pull both the left and right side cover board to stand vertically, than fasten the inside snap joint of both sides. Next step is to take out led tubes, put them in the right places and connect to each other. Once it's done you can plug the power supply. Let's check how it works, led light seems to be fine, you can adjust the light intesity as well. Meanwhile you can put together air hoses and attached it to the exhaust vent. That's it!   To show you how much operating space gives you this spray booth, I put some cars of various scales on the turn table. First Tamiya TT02 1:10, 2nd 1:19, 3rd 1:24, 4th 1:43 and 5th 1:64 I guess! And now the air flow test at max fan speed. Not bad! Sheet of paper stands still sticked to the air filter and when fans are switched off it slides down. It is BLK model as it has two knobs, first one to adjust airflow level and the 2nd one to adjust led light intesity. The LK model has switches: one with two airflow presets and second to switch on or off led lights.     Recording just for entertaining purposes, there might be as many ideas for doing it as number of all dicast in whole world :D I am a beginner but I am not afraid of mistakes :) If you enjoy the video you can like it, subscribe the channel, leave a comment or even donate via Paypal.

Air is entrained at point (B) and (D) by the compressed air stream that leaves the air knife from a small gap at point (C).  The entrained air follows the profile that directs the airflow in a perfect straight line to create a uniform sheet of air along the entire length of the Air Blade TM air knife.  The amplified air stream maximized velocity and force is maximized as a well-defined sheet of laminar flow with minimal wind shear for reduced energy use in blow off and cooling.
