A ideia é simples: fazer máquinas aprenderem, assim como nós humanos aprendemos durante a vida. Mas o desafio é inspirador! Como é que nós podemos programar máquinas que aprendem como seres humanos?

O Machine Learning representa um novo paradigma na programação, onde, em vez de programar regras explícitas em uma linguagem como Java ou C ++, você constrói um sistema treinado em dados para inferir as próprias regras. Mas como é realmente o ML? Na parte um do Machine Learning de Zero a 100 André Lírio nos apresenta um exemplo básico de construção de um modelo de ML, introduzindo idéias que aplicaremos em episódios posteriores a um problema mais interessante: a visão computacional.

2,Didática Tech,O que é Machine Learning (Aprendizado de Máquina)?,2019-06-21,UC0BiVs5EYh57gzGVvhddjsA,25325,1795,https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/qDmojpkd8rE/maxresdefault.webp,1920,1080,People & Blogs,conceito machine learning,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0BiVs5EYh57gzGVvhddjsA,"Nesse vídeo vamos aprender o que é machine learning (aprendizado de máquina) e por que essa área tem sido tão importante no mundo da inteligência artificial.
O vídeo está organizado da seguinte forma:
0:06 Explicação do conceito de machine learning
0:23 Primeiro exemplo
1:25 A diferença entre instruções, regras e aprendizado
2:18 Tentativa e erro
2:23 Segundo exemplo (xadrez)
4:17 O diferencial no algoritmo da Deep Mind Alpha Zero
6:10 Novos conhecimentos adquiridos pela inteligência artificial a partir de machine learning
7:15 O futuro do machine learning

Basicamente, o machine learning é a técnica de aprender com a experiência. Ou seja, a partir de muitas tentativas, o algoritmo mantém salvo um histórico daquilo que funciona e daquilo que não funciona, e vai evoluindo a cada nova iteração. No início, o programa apenas sabe as regras, e com o treinamento ele vai aprendendo por conta própria as estratégias. Escrevemos um artigo bastante completo em nosso site sobre machine learning, confira: https://didatica.tech/o-que-e-machine-learning-aprendizado-de-maquina/

Este é o quarto vídeo de uma playlist SENSACIONAL sobre Inteligência Artificial e que conta com o apoio da Alura e o seu co-fundador Guilherme Silveira.

Este vídeo em específico é a Introdução ao Machine Learning (Aprendizado de Máquina ou Aprendizagem de Maquina) mas de verdade estes ~43 minutos de estudo formam quase que um curso de Machine Learning para a falar a verdade de tanto conteúdo que foi discutido. Fora ser um tutorial prático de como utilizar a biblioteca ""scikit-learn"" que é uma das mais famosas para Python, conversamos sobre Ensaio Clínico Randomizado (Randomized Controlled Trial), Reinforcement Learning e como um algoritmo pode ficar se auto-atualizando automaticamente.

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. 

Below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence. We may be a long way from self-aware computers that think just like us, but with advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks our computers are becoming more powerful than ever.

Não, você não vai ver tudo que um cientista de dados vê durante a construção de um modelo preditivo, MAS vai passar pelas principais etapas. E, o melhor de tudo, não é necessário conhecimento prévio. Começamos com alguns conceitos de machine learning, passamos por tratativas dos dados, seguimos para análise exploratória e, enfim, chegamos no modelo para predição de risco do cliente.

ATENÇÃO: Vou repetir porque o vídeo teve alguns dislikes e eu tenho quase certeza que é por conta disso. Veja bem pessoal, note que o ponto do vídeo é mostrar as diversas etapas na construção de um modelo, de uma forma simplificada. Isso não te tornará de imediato um cientista de dados completo. Para cada etapa há INÚMERAS tratativas, várias vias para tomar. E há datasets muito mais complexos. No futuro, demonstrarei mais sobre essas tratativas e esses datasets, mas por enquanto achei interessante este vídeo para vocês terem uma visão do todo.

Machine Learning possibilita a construção de sistemas que aprendem e se otimizam automaticamente com dados, e tudo isso coloca a aprendizagem de máquina na vanguarda absoluta de praticamente qualquer campo que se baseia em dados, como saúde, educação, esportes e muitas outras.

Exemplos de Machine Learning:
- Os carros autônomos do Google que dirigem sozinhos? A essência do aprendizado de máquina.
- Ofertas de recomendações online como as da Amazon e Netflix? Aplicações de aprendizado de máquina na vida cotidiana.
- Saber o que os clientes estão dizendo sobre você no Twitter? Aprendizado de máquina combinado com a criação de regra linguística.
- Detecção de fraudes? Um dos usos mais óbvios e importantes em nosso mundo de hoje.

Acesse o site: https://didatica.tech/

Basicamente, existem 4 grandes áreas da matemática fundamentais para o aprendizado de machine learning e inteligência artificial: 
- Probabilidade (Teorema de Bayes, Eventos, etc.)
- Estatística (variância, desvio padrão, MAE/MSE, ROC/AUC, distribuição normal, p-value, ANOVA, correlação, coeficiente de determinação R2, etc.)
- Cálculo (limites, derivada, derivada parcial, máximos e mínimos de funções, integral, etc.)
- Álgebra linear (operações com matrizes, cálculo vetorial, autovalores e autovetores, etc.)

Mas o mais importante é estudar matemática juntamente com os algoritmos de machine learning, para aprender de forma associativa.

We're going to take into account:
-salaries and job openings growth in the United States and United Kingdom 
-barriers to entry (do you need a specialised degree like PhD?)
-your predispositions 
-predictions for the next 10 years

I believe that the most important factor in deciding whether you should pursue machine learning or software engineering are *your predispositions* - your talents, skills and natural abilities! At the end of the day, machine learning and software engineering are completely different fields, so the nature of work is totally different. It's better to specialise in the field that you're naturally more suited to do, because then you learn faster!

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live, and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now, let us deep dive into this short video and understand the basics of Machine Learning

 I used Gigapixel AI to upscale and enhance the original video.  I also used DAIN to make the original 30 frame videos into 60 frames per second   If you're watching on a phone then you're likely won't see too much of a difference, but if you're on a desktop or tv and are watching in 2K, 4k or 8K you should see a stark difference, especially if you click on the original video after to see how grainy and blurry it look now on modern monitors.  Even if you don't have an 4K or 8K monitor, you can still click on those options to get a better bitrate and quality.  The only issue is you might get frame lag.  If that's the case you might want to check your settings on Chrome to see if you have hardware acceleration on, in many cases that will help with the lag. Let us know what other upscales you'd like to see.  Hope you enjoy!

AI vs ML vs DL

My doubt was why these words used interchangeably even when they are not the same. 

I came to a conclusion about this while I was going through AI vs ML vs DL which I'll be briefing in the last.

Hierarchy-

DL is subset of ML which is further a subset of AI.

DL is the way in which ML is achieved. 
ML is the way in which AI is achieved. 

AI- Artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence and trying to to make machine as intelligent as human.

This can be achieved by again mimicking the process by which by which human becomes intelligent and that is learning so here comes machine-learning which tries to make machine learn and make itself intelligent which is again a part of artificial.

So here we came across the term machine learning so machine learning was about described as making machine learn and make itself intelligent but how can we make machine learn?

Here again we go for a mimicking human by which he Learns and uses his intelligence. How does human achieve this?
He does this by or with the help of his brain how does his brain become capable of doing search extremely wonderful things that is because of the neural network in his brain which is a collection for cluster of millions and billions of neurones forming a network which are interlinked through a synapse. Show the process of making this brings a new buzzword that is data science.

So if we back forget now we will learn that data science is the way by which machine learning is achieved and machine learning is the way by which artificial intelligence is achieved as all these three are interlinked.

So There comes a obvious overlap between this three fields that is why in most of the cases which we find, we realise that these words are used interchangeably.

In the images you will find something called hardcoded stuff what I mean by it is is the basic image recognition which we do by using computer vision using open CV library openCV which does not include any kind of artificial intelligence or machine learning or data science completely. But it can be argued that they have a common overlap.

Talking about the examples.

The best example that anyone could give of artificial intelligence is is Google assistant or Siri or Cortana as you have already mentioned these I would like to add voice to text converters that uses AI.

And coming to machine learning I personally I like to give the example of stock prediction.

And for deep learning ANN- artificial neural network ard an example.

Even it can be argued that each of the examples mentioned above can be interchangeably used for examples of others like voice to text converter can be purely achieved through machine learning also.

So it is just the matter of how we realise these three and applied to our our desired need.

All of this is explained in Telugu. So, it your responsibility to share this information with other telugu mates...

After you have engineered the features and tested different models, you see how the prediction performance improves. However, the job is not done when you have a high performing model. The deployment of your models is a crucial step in the overall workflow and it is the point in time when your models actually become useful to your company.

In this session you will learn about various possibilities and best practices to bring machine learning models into production environments. The goal is not only to make live prediction calls or have the models available as REST API, but also what needs to be considered to maintain them. This talk will focus on solutions with Python (flask, Cloud Foundry, Docker, and more) and the well established ML packages such as Spark MLlib, scikit-learn, and xgboost, but the concepts can be easily transferred to other languages and frameworks.

But this demand is definitely felt at a greater degree in countries with well-established tech hubs and existing technological infrastructure! In this video I will be talking about which countries in the world are the best for machine learning engineers; in terms of job opportunities, access to the latest in AI technology, digital literacy rate in the country, as well as salaries. 

The world economic forum released a report on the future of work (link: ), and it gave a detailed report on some of the world’s top and emerging economies. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers are going to be in extremely high demand in most of the developed economies like; US, UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc. 

Singapore has one of the highest digital literacy rates in the world as well as the highest percentage of companies planning on adopting AI and machine learning into their products and services, hence it will be a great hub for machine learning engineers and data scientists. In fact, over the last year those positions have doubled. 

Australia, UK and China, also have high AI & ML adoption rates as well as digital literacy so they will also be giant hubs of innovation in machine learning, especially a country like China. The United States has some of the highest salaries in the world for machine learning engineers and because of that it will attract the best talent in machine learning and AI. In the next 5 years we will be seeing not just US companies use ML, we will also be seeing ML startups being created in the US. Besides these, India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Poland are emerging hubs for machine learning and they would easily be in the top 5 list in the next five years.

81,Smitha Kolan - Machine Learning Engineer,Data Science VS Machine Learning: Which One To Pick For 2021-2022!,2021-05-23,UCsh8qhZ4Wm2IJDRsNr_5Z0A,8469,402,https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/EIJecEBETso/maxresdefault.webp,1920,1080,Science & Technology,machine learning|data science|machine learning engineer|data scientist|how to learn ml|how to learn machine learning|data science vs machine learning,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsh8qhZ4Wm2IJDRsNr_5Z0A,"Data Science and Machine Learning are both lucrative fields within artificial intelligence and tech. But which one is the best to learn? In this video I talk about exactly what is data science and machine learning and what is the difference between them. 

What is Data Science:
Data Science is the process of making sense of data, often times larges amounts of data (also known as big data), and identifying meaningful patterns which are useful for making business decisions and can play a significant role in creating solutions to problems. It's used in a multitude of industries; finance and banking, transportation, health, etc.

What is Machine Learning:
Machine learning on the other hand, refers to the algorithms which machine learning engineers and even data scientists use in order to make a machine learn from data and apply the learning to new sets of data and get the answers we are looking for.

Where do they overlap:
Data science is not machine learning, but they do overlap, lots of data scientists make use of machine learning and vice versa. However, there are parts of machine learning that are completely unrelated to data science. A data scientist's job includes translating business questions into specific quantitative questions that can be answered with available data using statistical methodologies. In cases where questions cannot be answered with available data, they work with engineers to produce the required data.

Machine learning engineers design, implement and deliver ML components along with high quality software to solve complex problems. They also develop ML models using variety of ML design approaches as well as making use of knowledge such as data processing, regression, clustering, recommendations, classification, experimentation, model optimization.

In this video, I’ll walk you through using Weka - The very first machine learning library I’ve ever tried. What’s great is that Weka comes with a GUI that makes it easy to visualize your datasets, and train and evaluate different classifiers. I’ll give you a quick walkthrough of the tool, from installation all the way to running experiments, and show you some of what it can do. This is a helpful library to have while you’re learning ML, and I still find it useful today to experiment with new datasets. Note: In the video, I quickly went through testing. This is an important topic in ML, and how you design and evaluate your experiments is even more important than the classifier you use. Although I publish these videos at turtle speed, I’ve started working on an experimental design one, and that’ll be next! Also, we will soon publish some testing tips and best practices on tensorflow.org (https://goo.gl/nZcS5R).

Machine  learning  ما هو 
شرح machine learning
يعتبر مجال تعلم الأله او ال machine learning 
Machine learning 
ML
The 7 Steps of Machine Learning
مجال مهم دلوقتي وبيتطور بسرعة واكيد سمعت عنه كتير في الفيديو ده بقي هقولك 
 واحد من اكتر المجالات اللي عاملة ترند دلوقتي وبقي فيها كلام كتير ووظايف كتير وشركات كتير بقت تطلبها 
بس الأول يعني ايه machine learning
machine learning عبارة  تطبيق للذكاء الاصطناعي AI  ويعتبر عبارة عن تنقيات وأدوات بتستخدم الداتا اللي عندك عشان تديك إجابات معينة ليها قيمه  يعني بأختصار بياخد داتا يحللها يعمل منها خبره عشان لما يتسأل يقدر يجاوب بناء علي Data  دي 
زي بالظبط لما تذاكر وتروح تمتحن معاك كتاب هتذكره وتجرب أسئلة كتير من الداتا اللي عندك وتحل مسائل كتير معاك حلها وبعد كدة تروح علي الامتحان تلاقي أسئلة ومسائل زي اللي حلتها وتقدر تحلها او بالاصل تحاول تحلها 
هو  ده نفس فكرة ML زي بالظبط الطفل الصغير اللي بتعمله خطوه خطوة المشي لحد لما يمشي وبعدها هو هو بيمشي لوحده
يعني تقدر تعتبر Machine learning  عبارة عن حاجتين ورا بعض 
1- Training
2- Prediction   
التدريب هو بأستخدام Data  اللي هي الدهب بالنسبة ليك  واللي بيخدمها الماشين لاينج سيستم ويتدرب عليها ويحللها ويعمل منها  Models  
يقدر بعدها يستخدمها في توقع نتايج لداتا جديدة عليه في المرحلة التانية من ا ML 
وطبعا كل ما الداتا تكبر وتزيد كل ما Models  اللي طلعت بعد التدريب او التحليل هتبقي اكتر بكتير وافضل بكتير والتوقع هيبقي افضل بكتير جدا 
فكلمة السر هنا في المجال ده هي الداتا 
ومش في المجال ده بس الداتا دلوقتي هي عصب كل التقنيات والشركات والأنظمة هي الحرب الالكترونية الجديدة 
زي ما انتوا شايفين مثلا الصراع مع برنامج تيك توك او برنامج فيس اب
وتفاصيل ومشاكل الفيس بوك  وجوجل من سنة او اتنين تقريبا 
كلها بتتعلق Data اللي هي فعلا بقت زي النفط في عالم التكنولوجيا التنقيات واللي بيتملك الداتا معاه كنز حقيقي يقدر يستخدمه وياخد من خلاله قرارات تفيده وتفيد شركته ومجاله 
وطبعا مجال ML  من غير الرياضة ملوش لازمة عشان كدة قبل ما تقول يا ماشين تقول يا Math  ك 

ايه استخدمات Machine learning  
انت دلوقتي ممكن تكون بتشوف واحد من استخدمات ML  
زي مثلا Recommendations  علي اليوتيوب انه يعملك الليست بتاعة الفيديوهات بناء علي اللي انت شوفته  
ولو ده هو التطبيق الوحيده فده كافي وكفاية Amazon  اللي تقدر دلوقتي تتوقع مشترياتك او حالتك 
لدرجة انها تقدر تعرف هل الست حامل ولا لأ بتغير بسيط من أسلوب شراءها علي الانترنت وكمان تقدر تعرف هي في الشهر الكام كمان قبل ما الست نفسها تعرف 
او زي Face recognition  ان الفيس بوك او جوجل او تليفونك مثلا يقدر يحدد صور الناس اللي في الصورة 
Text To speech
زي اوبر uber مثلا اللي بتسخدمه أنظمة الماشين لاينج انها تتوقع أوقات وأماكن الزحمه ومن خلالها تقدر تعمل حاجات كتير منها عروض ومنها أسعار معينة في أوقات معينة وهكذا  وده بس في مجال التكنولجيا المعلومات لكن طبعا في استخدمات تانية في الطب والاحصاء والبورصة وما ادراك ما قيمة التوقع في البورصات 
فانت كل يوم بتستخدم أنظمة من ML والممتع ان كل يوم بيزيد داتا وكل يوم بيتعلم اكتر ونسبه خطأه بتقل اقل واكتر 
في برامج تقدر تعمل شكل مش موجود في الحقيقه أصلا يعني الكومبيوتر يعمل وش بني ادم انت لو شوفتها متقدرش تقول ده مش حقيقي وهو أصلا مش موجوود في الحقيقة معمول   ML  بأستخدام داتا كتييير قوي بس من صور الناس الحقيقة زي مثلا فيس اب 
this person does not exist

طيب ازاي  دي بتشتغل أصلا  - كيف يعمل Machine learning 

Gathering data
Preparing that data
Choosing a model
Training
Evaluation
Hyperparameter tuning
Prediction.

Choosing the right evaluation metric for your machine learning project is crucial, as it decides which model you’ll ultimately use. Those coming to ML from software development are often self-taught, but practice exercises and competitions generally dictate the evaluation metric. In a real-world scenario, how do you choose an appropriate metric? This talk will explore the important evaluation metrics used in regression and classification tasks, their pros and cons, and how to make a smart decision."

What’s more, most available machine learning toolboxes (e.g. scikit-learn) are limited to the tabular setting, and cannot easily be applied to time series data.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to apply common machine learning techniques to time series and how to extend available toolkits. This is a beginner-friendly tutorial: we assume familiarity with scikit-learn, but no prior experience with time series.

To start, you’ll learn how to distinguish between different kinds of temporal data and associated learning tasks, such as forecasting and time series classification. You’ll then learn how to solve these tasks with machine learning techniques specific to time series data, including:

State-of-the-art algorithms for time series classification and regression, Reduction strategies, i.e. solving a complex learning tasks by decomposing it into simpler tasks, e.g. solving forecasting via regression, Composite strategies like ensembling and pipelining, as well as data transformations like detrending and feature extraction. We’ll work through all of them step by step and make use of interactive Jupyter notebooks and sktime, a new scikit-learn compatible toolbox for machine learning with time series: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime

Some of the most famous ones in the industry include R, python & Mathlab.
In this video I highlight the positives & negatives of each of the language. I also discuss which language is used the most in the #machinelearning industry and also which language will get you hired!

Although most beginners go for Python, don't be too quick to brush off R & Mathlab.

Python:
An extremely popular programming language in machine learning & data science but also in general software development. It's open source, so there are tons of resources and out there and great support available. Python also has some of the best machine learning and deep learning libraries like tensorflow, keras, pytorch, etc. 

R:
Well known programming language and environment that was basically built to do high level analytical work. Used by researchers & academics in the field of computing and statistics. R is starting to build a reputation for itself in the machine learning world because of how well it performs with huge datasets unlike python. It is also thought to be harder to learn than python but that is not true.

Mathlab:
Software & programing language used in universities in schools mostly. Extremely good at handling mathematical tasks such as graphing and matrices. Great visual interface for data representation unlike python & R. Biggest drawback of Mathlab is that it's not open source, hence much less support and free resources available online for it.

Artificial intelligence applications are opening up our understanding of ourselves and disease, and we must strive to create tools that can work as partners in research, not simply as black boxes. Barbara Engelhardt is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University since 2014.  She graduated from Stanford University and received her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Professor Michael Jordan. She did postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago, working with Professor Matthew Stephens, and three years at Duke University as an assistant professor. Interspersed among her academic experiences, she spent two years working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a summer at Google Research, and a year at 23andMe, a DNA ancestry service. Professor Engelhardt received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship, the Walter M. Fitch Prize from the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, an NIH NHGRI K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, and the Sloan Faculty Fellowship. Professor Engelhardt is currently a PI on the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium. Her research interests involve statistical models and methods for analysis of high-dimensional data, with a goal of understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of complex phenotypes and human diseases.

The simulation was implemented using Unity's ML-Agents framework (https://unity3d.com/machine-learning). The AI consists of a deep Neural Network with 3 hidden layers of 128 neurons each. It is trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a Reinforcement Learning approach.

Basically, the input of the Neural Network are the readings of eight depth sensors, the car's current speed and position, as well as its relative position to the target. The outputs of the Neural Network are interpreted as engine force, braking force and turning force. These outputs can be seen at the top right corner of the zoomed out camera shots.

The AI starts off with random behaviour, i.e. the Neural Network is initialized with random weights. It then gradually learns to solve the task by reacting to environment feedback accordingly. The environment tells the AI whether it is doing good or bad with positive or negative reward signals.
In this project, the AI is rewarded with small positive signals for getting closer to the parking spot, which is outlined in red, and gets a larger reward when it actually reaches the parking spot and stops there. The final reward for reaching the parking spot is dependent on how parallel the car stops in relation to the actual parking position. If the car stops in a 90° angle to the actual parking direction for instance, the AI will only be rewarded a very small amount, relative to the amount it would get for stopping completely parallel to the actual direction.
The AI is penalized with a negative reward signal, when it either drives further away from the parking spot or if it crashes into any obstacles.

The training process shown in this video took about 23 hours on a computer with an i5 (7th or 8th gen) and a GTX 1070 with 100x simulation speed.

This paper highlights some of the areas of highest potential impact, including to accelerate direct numerical simulations, to improve turbulence closure modeling, and to develop enhanced reduced-order models. In each of these areas, it is possible to improve machine learning capabilities by incorporating physics into the process, and in turn, to improve the simulation of fluids to uncover new physical understanding. Despite the promise of machine learning described here, we also note that classical methods are often more efficient for many tasks. We also emphasize that in order to harness the full potential of machine learning to improve computational fluid dynamics, it is essential for the community to continue to establish benchmark systems and best practices for open-source software, data sharing, and reproducible research.

However, it can often be a hurdle for many to learn the math involved in machine learning. There are levels to the math in machine learning, depending on your ideal role in the machine learning industry. If you are planning on working in research roles, you would need the learn math at a more advanced level than if you were interested in working in machine learning engineer roles or data scientist roles.

Here's a brief list of the most basic math required for machine learning:
1. linear algebra
2. probability and statistics
3. multivariate calculus
4. basic algorithm complexity

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning, what is Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning, what is Reinforcement Learning and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various businesses. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live, and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now, let's deep dive into this short video on Machine learning and understand the basics of Machine Learning.

Below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? (00:52)
2. What is Supervised Learning? (01:25)
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? (01:52)
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? (02:25)

It’s completely free and in this video I discuss why google created this course as well as what you can expect from it! This machine learning course by Google has been in the works for quite some time now, so it was pretty much expected that it would be released one this year. One of the main reasons why Google has released this course is to promote its tensorflow API, which is a popular machine learning and deep learning library. With how big machine learning is going to be in the next decade, Google wants to make sure that it stays on top of the game by ensuring that machine learning engineers use its tensorflow library! 

The course itself is a basic introductory course to machine learning and covers all the basics quite well. The best thing about the course is that it takes on a really practical approach to machine learning! This is something that is pretty rare as most machine learning courses are highly theoretical and lots of developers struggle with learning in this regard. We can also expect other tech giants like facebook come out with a course as well in the future, to promote it’s own pytorch library!

Very frequently, press coverage and even practitioners of analytics use the terms Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning interchangeably. Disregarding the difference between AI and machine learning and deep learning.

However, these three concepts do not represent the same. In this video, we are going to break this down for you, giving you examples of use cases making the difference between ai and machine learning and deep learning more clear.

Any device that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chances of success, can be said to have some kind of artificial intelligence, more frequently referred to as A.I. 

More specifically, when a machine has ""cognitive"" capabilities, such as problem solving and learning by example it is usually associated with A.I.

Artificial Intelligence has three different levels: 

Narrow AI: when a computer can perform one task much better than a human; this is where we stand nowadays.

2. General AI: when a machine can successfully perform any given intellectual task that a human being can too

3. Strong AI: when machines can beat humans in many of tasks.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI. 
This is what most applications of AI in business rely on currently. Want to know more about how businesses are applying AI? Watch this video, in which we cover a list of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOEFogy9VSQ&t=21s

And finally, as a subset of machine learning, there’s Deep Learning. It is called “deep” because it makes use of deep artificial neural networks.

An increasing number of applications require the joint use of signal processing and machine learning techniques on time series and sensor data. MATLAB can accelerate the development of data analytics and sensor processing systems by providing a full range of modelling and design capabilities within a single environment.
In this webinar we present an example of a classification system able to identify the physical activity that a human subject is engaged in, solely based on the accelerometer signals generated by his or her smartphone.

We introduce common signal processing methods in MATLAB (including digital filtering and frequency-domain analysis) that help extract descripting features from raw waveforms, and we show how parallel computing can accelerate the processing of large datasets. We then discuss how to explore and test different classification algorithms (such as decision trees, support vector machines, or neural networks) both programmatically and interactively.

Finally, we demonstrate the use of automatic C/C++ code generation from MATLAB to deploy a streaming classification algorithm for embedded sensor analytics."

Yes! The big 4 math disciplines that make up machine learning are linear algebra, probability theory, calculus, and statistics. I'm going to cover how each are used by going through a linear regression problem that predicts the price of an apartment in NYC based on its price per square foot. Then we'll switch over to a logistic regression model to change it up a bit. This will be a hands-on way to see how each of these disciplines are used in the field.

It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[3] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.

Glad to be back! Decision Tree classifiers are intuitive, interpretable, and one of my favorite supervised learning algorithms. In this episode, I’ll walk you through writing a Decision Tree classifier from scratch, in pure Python. I’ll introduce concepts including Decision Tree Learning, Gini Impurity, and Information Gain. Then, we’ll code it all up. Understanding how to accomplish this was helpful to me when I studied Machine Learning for the first time, and I hope it will prove useful to you as well.

Developers who are moving towards Artificial intelligence and Machine learning are confused as which language is the best choice.
This video answers that.

In this video we will see :
- Which is the best language to learn AI
- In AI language doesn’t matter. Language is needed when we want to implement the algorithm.
- Selection of language based on 
     Ranking 
     Area of work 
     Background 
- Ranking
Based on use and number of libraries available the top 5 languages are :
1. Python 
2. Java 
3. C/C++
4. Javascript 
5. R language 

- Area of work or Domain :
If working on Natural Language Processing or Sentiment Analysis then Python is best language as there are many libraries available

If domain is Enterprise like Big Data, Fraud detection, Network security then best language is Java

If working on Robots, Speech recognition, Games then no doubt go for C and C++

- Tensorflow.js
- Javascript 
- R language

Hello and welcome to Acadgild’s tutorial on data science.
In this video, we explain the difference between three key concepts artificial intelligence vs machine learning vs deep learning – to understand how they relate to the field of data science.

First up, artificial intelligence or AI! What is it?
Artificial intelligence is simply any code, technique or algorithm that enables machines to mimic, develop and demonstrate human cognition or behavior.

We are in, what many refer to as, the era of “weak AI”. The technology is still in its infancy and is expected to make machines capable of doing anything and everything humans do, in the era of “strong AI”.
To transition from weak AI to strong AI, machines need to learn the ways of humans. The techniques and processes, which help machines in this endeavor are broadly categorized under machine learning.
Machines learn in predominantly two ways. Their learning is either supervised or unsupervised.
In supervised learning, machines learn to predict outcomes with help from data scientists.
In unsupervised learning, machines learn to predict outcomes on the go by recognizing patterns in input data.

When machines can draw meaningful inferences from large volumes of data sets, they demonstrate the ability to learn deeply.
Deep learning requires artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are like the biological neural networks in humans. These networks contain nodes in different layers that are connected and communicate with each other to make sense of voluminous input data.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which in turn, is a subset of artificial intelligence.
The three technologies help scientists and analysts interpret tons of data and are hence crucial for the field of data science.
To learn more about these technologies, subscribe to Acadgild’s blog and Youtube channel. To become an expert, join one of our courses.
Thank you for watching and happy learning!

Walk through the three types of machine learning (clustering, classification, and regression) in this overview by Loren Shure. 
3 Things you need to know about machine learning: http://bit.ly/2PG4qee

Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. In this video, you’ll start by learning about clustering, which helps you segment a collection of things into groups with distinct attributes. You’ll next explore classification, which you’d use for applications like object detection in images, predictive maintenance, and spam detection. Lastly, you’ll hear about regression, which is used to build models that predict a response along a continuum given other features.

I would also detail how the model was built and challenges faced along the way. This would lead to a short concluding discussion on the broad possibilities of this technology, ranging from detecting radicalization on the web to customer reviews on Amazon. This would relate it back to real-world applications that matter to everyone, not just those in the tech sphere. 
 Andy Kim is a junior at Deerfield Academy. Ever since coding for the first time in elementary school, Andy has been passionate about all things computer science. He has pursued research in a variety of fields, including astrophysics, facial recognition, as well as sentiment analysis, the topic of his talk. 
Andy is fascinated with harnessing the power of machine learning to analyze human communication. He believes as more and more of our lives become digitized, sentiment analysis will become a valuable tool in evaluating our digital interactions. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx"

The challenge with data is the variety across locations (cloud, on-prem, private cloud), types (structured, unstructured), and platforms (operational database, data warehouse, hadoop, fast data platforms, etc). Once we deal with our data management, we are able to move on to analytics, which lets us extract insight from our data. Predictive analytics leads us to machine learning.  Once we develop enough machine learning models, we are beginning to reach AI.

Discovering physical laws and governing dynamical systems is often enabled by first learning a new coordinate system where the dynamics become simple.  This is true for the heliocentric Copernican system, which enabled Kepler's laws and Newton's F=ma, for the Fourier transform, which diagonalizes the heat equation, and many others.  In this video, we discuss how deep learning is being used to discover effective coordinate systems where simple dynamical systems models may be discovered.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. 

What is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, we use known or labeled data for the training data. Since the data is known, the learning is, therefore, supervised, i.e., directed into successful execution. The input data goes through the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. 

What is Unsupervised Learning?
In unsupervised learning, the training data is unknown and unlabeled - meaning that no one has looked at the data before. Without the aspect of known data, the input cannot be guided to the algorithm, which is where the unsupervised term originates from. This data is fed to the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. The trained model tries to search for a pattern and give the desired response. In this case, it is often like the algorithm is trying to break code like the Enigma machine but without the human mind directly involved but rather a machine.

What is Reinforcement Learning?
Like traditional types of data analysis, here, the algorithm discovers data through a process of trial and error and then decides what action results in higher rewards. Three major components make up reinforcement learning: the agent, the environment, and the actions. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, the environment includes everything that the agent interacts with, and the actions are what the agent does.

254,Ken Jee,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,2021-12-03,UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,13326,700,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FqNpDNmpcEo/maxresdefault.jpg,3840,2160,People & Blogs,Data Science|Ken Jee|Machine Learning|zillow|zillow stock|real estate crash|zillow loss|ibuyer|zillow flip|zillow offers|zillow ai|zestimate|machine learning goes wrong|bad data science|zillow crash|zillow ibuyer|algorithm|ai scary|real estate,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg,"Zillow was leading the tech revolution in real estate. How could they make a $500,000,000 mistake in the hottest market in real estate history. Was this a problem with the Machine Learning Model they were using (the Zestimate), or something even more concerning? 

To be clear, the opinions expressed in this video are my own and based on what I think happened with Zillow. I only have access to public news articles and data, so this is all speculation. 

0:00 Zillow Starting Strong
1:15 What is Zillow Offers?
2:37 $500,000,000 Loss
3:14 What is the Zestimate Really?
4:45 Is the Machine Learning Model at Fault?
7:15 How Did It Get Out of Hand?
9:55 Is Machine Learning Evil?

In 2018 Zillow was riding high. They were dominating the real-estate marketplace with a digital tech offering. Their CEO, Rich Barton, had a wild idea. Could he use the estimates that they were generating to buy houses at under market value, fix them up, and then sell them for a profit. There were a lot of positives for this plan, first, home buying can be difficult. For the seller, buying directly through Zillow could be almost as simple as a click of a button, especially if they were getting a decent price for the house. You also could avoid many of the closing costs & additional fees with a third-party realtor. 

They already had a the zestimate system to evaluate housing prices. Could they just take that a step further and use that for real buying decisions? The company seemed to think so. That same year they started Zillow Offers, this platform would essentially make instantaneous offers on properties. This practice is known now as iBuying. 

By October of this year, Zillow disclosed that it wrote down over 500 million dollars of losses do to houses that were purchased at too high a price through the 3rd and 4th quarter of the year.

Problems 
1) The Zestimate wasn't used as it was initially intended. Did the company make the necessary changes to leverage it for buying houses?
2) House flipping was very different from the transactions the CEO has been used to. This new market has distinct differences from previous machine learning projects he has worked on
3) A volatile market is a bad time to test a model 
4) Greed and poor incentives appear to have crept into decision making

Data quality is more important than model complexity/fanciness

As an AI practitioner, it’s important you shy away from model-centric Machine Learning, and embrace a data-centric approach.

Often, implementing the latest model boosts accuracy by a few decimals at best, over a good baseline. Compared to model enhancement, ensuring you have high quality data can have 10x improvement.

NOTE: In the video to calculate the RMSE I put the following statement:
rmse=np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions- y_test)**2))

When in fact I meant to put :
rmse=np.sqrt(np.mean(((predictions- y_test)**2)))

You can use the following statements to calculate RMSE:
1. rmse =np.sqrt(np.mean(((predictions- y_test)**2)))
2. rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.power((np.array(y_test)-np.array(predictions)),2)))
3. rmse = np.sqrt(((predictions - y_test) ** 2).mean())

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, with Machine Learning, computers find insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.

287,Machine Learning Street Talk,#60 Geometric Deep Learning Blueprint (Special Edition),2021-09-18,UCMLtBahI5DMrt0NPvDSoIRQ,32336,1285,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bIZB1hIJ4u8/maxresdefault.jpg,1920,1080,People & Blogs,,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMLtBahI5DMrt0NPvDSoIRQ,"""Symmetry, as wide or narrow as you may define its meaning, is one idea by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order, beauty, and perfection."" and that was a quote from Hermann Weyl, a German mathematician who was born in the late 19th century. 

The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact tractable given enough computational horsepower. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation.

While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not uniform and have strong repeating patterns as a result of the low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. 

Geometric Deep Learning unifies a broad class of ML problems from the perspectives of symmetry and invariance. These principles not only underlie the breakthrough performance of convolutional neural networks and the recent success of graph neural networks but also provide a principled way to construct new types of problem-specific inductive biases.

This week we spoke with Professor Michael Bronstein (head of graph ML at Twitter) and Dr. 
Petar Veličković (Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind), and Dr. Taco Cohen and Prof. Joan Bruna about their new proto-book Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges. 

We hope you enjoy the show!

In this full tutorial course, you will get a solid foundation in reinforcement learning core topics.

The course covers Q learning, SARSA, double Q learning, deep Q learning, and policy gradient methods. These algorithms are employed in a number of environments from the open AI gym, including space invaders, breakout, and others. The deep learning portion uses Tensorflow and PyTorch.

The course begins with more modern algorithms, such as deep q learning and policy gradient methods, and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning.

Then the course teaches some of the fundamental concepts that power all reinforcement learning algorithms. These are illustrated by coding up some algorithms that predate deep learning, but are still foundational to the cutting edge. These are studied in some of the more traditional environments from the OpenAI gym, like the cart pole problem.

Join me on #100DaysOfML and follow along to learn machine learning! 

Day 8 of 100:
Linear Regression is one of the most basic machine model in machine learning. There are numerous ways to implement linear regression and least squares is of the most standard ways in which you can do so. In today's video we will look at how to implement least squares using only the Numpy library. So this will be a great way of learning to implement the math behind it. 

We will be splitting our dataset into training and testing and we will be calculating the weight matrix using linear algebra. The weight matrix will be calculated based on the training data set. We will also look how to implement the root mean square error function and we will calculate both testing and training errors.

Tell us what you think in the comments!

From the associated blog piece:
""Reproducibility is nice, but data drift, new business requirements, bug fixes, etc. all mean running a slightly modified experiment. You don't have time to always start from scratch. Versioned reproducibility means tracking changes to the experiment state. DVC can determine what changes were introduced by the experiment and only run what's necessary. It only saves those changes, so you don't waste time or storage on duplicate copies of data.""

Trong khoa học máy tính, trí tuệ nhân tạo hay AI (tiếng Anh: Artificial Intelligence), đôi khi được gọi là trí thông minh nhân tạo, là trí thông minh được thể hiện bằng máy móc, trái ngược với trí thông minh tự nhiên được con người thể hiện. Thông thường, thuật ngữ ""trí tuệ nhân tạo"" thường được sử dụng để mô tả các máy móc (hoặc máy tính) bắt chước các chức năng ""nhận thức"" mà con người liên kết với tâm trí con người, như ""học tập"" và ""giải quyết vấn đề"".

Học máy (tiếng Anh: machine learning) là một lĩnh vực của trí tuệ nhân tạo liên quan đến việc nghiên cứu và xây dựng các kĩ thuật cho phép các hệ thống ""học"" tự động từ dữ liệu để giải quyết những vấn đề cụ thể. Ví dụ như các máy có thể ""học"" cách phân loại thư điện tử xem có phải thư rác (spam) hay không và tự động xếp thư vào thư mục tương ứng. Học máy rất gần với suy diễn thống kê (statistical inference) tuy có khác nhau về thuật ngữ.

Học máy (máy học) có liên quan lớn đến thống kê, vì cả hai lĩnh vực đều nghiên cứu việc phân tích dữ liệu, nhưng khác với thống kê, học máy tập trung vào sự phức tạp của các giải thuật trong việc thực thi tính toán. Nhiều bài toán suy luận được xếp vào loại bài toán NP-khó, vì thế một phần của học máy là nghiên cứu sự phát triển các giải thuật suy luận xấp xỉ mà có thể xử lý được.

Học máy có hiện nay được áp dụng rộng rãi bao gồm máy truy tìm dữ liệu, chẩn đoán y khoa, phát hiện thẻ tín dụng giả, phân tích thị trường chứng khoán, phân loại các chuỗi DNA, nhận dạng tiếng nói và chữ viết, dịch tự động, chơi trò chơi và cử động rô-bốt (robot locomotion).

Học sâu (tiếng Anh: deep learning) là một chi của ngành máy học dựa trên một tập hợp các thuật toán để cố gắng mô hình dữ liệu trừu tượng hóa ở mức cao bằng cách sử dụng nhiều lớp xử lý với cấu trúc phức tạp, hoặc bằng cách khác bao gồm nhiều biến đổi phi tuyến.

Học sâu là một phần của một họ các phương pháp học máy rộng hơn dựa trên đại diện học của dữ liệu. Một quan sát (ví dụ như, một hình ảnh) có thể được biểu diễn bằng nhiều cách như một vector của các giá trị cường độ cho mỗi điểm ảnh, hoặc một cách trừu tượng hơn như là một tập hợp các cạnh, các khu vực hình dạng cụ thể, vv. Một vài đại diện làm khiến việc học các nhiệm vụ dễ dàng hơn (ví dụ, nhận dạng khuôn mặt hoặc biểu hiện cảm xúc trên khuôn mặt) từ các ví dụ. Một trong những hứa hẹn của học sâu là thay thế các tính năng thủ công bằng các thuật toán hiệu quả đối với học không có giám sát hoặc nửa giám sát và tính năng phân cấp.

Các nghiên cứu trong lĩnh vực này cố gắng thực hiện các đại diện tốt hơn và tạo ra các mô hình để tìm hiểu các đại diện này từ dữ liệu không dán nhãn quy mô lớn. Một số đại diện được lấy cảm hứng bởi những tiến bộ trong khoa học thần kinh và được dựa trên các giải thích của mô hình xử lý và truyền thông thông tin trong một hệ thống thần kinh, chẳng hạn như mã hóa thần kinh để cố gắng để xác định các mối quan hệ giữa các kích thích khác nhau và các phản ứng liên quan đến thần kinh trong não.

Nhiều kiến trúc học sâu khác nhau như mạng neuron sâu, mã mạng neuron tích chập sâu, mạng niềm tin sâu và mạng neuron tái phát đã được áp dụng cho các lĩnh vực như thị giác máy tính, tự động nhận dạng giọng nói, xử lý ngôn ngữ tự nhiên, nhận dạng âm thanh ngôn ngữ và tin sinh học, chúng đã được chứng minh là tạo ra các kết quả rất tốt đối với nhiều nhiệm vụ khác nhau.

Ngoài ra, học sâu đã trở thành một từ ngữ thời thượng, hay một thương hiệu của mạng neuron.

Les algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique et les réseaux de neurones font tourner YouTube, Google, Amazon, Facebook… la reconnaissance vocale, la voiture autonome, les hôpitaux, le système judiciaire. Le monde entier se tourne vers cette technologie. Mais pourquoi donc ?
Et bien il faut savoir qu’à l’origine, les ordinateurs ne sont pas intelligents. Ils sont juste doués pour faire des calculs. Mais tous les problèmes ne peuvent pas être résolu par des calculs : par exemple reconnaitre un chat depuis le signal électrique que notre œil nous envoie.
Mais le Machine Learning (apprentissage automatique) donne la capacité aux ordinateurs de dépasser cette limite en leur fournissant la capacité d’apprendre à faire une tâche à partir de données.
Pour cela, il existe ce qu’on appelle des algorithmes d’apprentissage, et il en existe 3 grandes familles :
- Le Supervised Learning (apprentissage supervisé) qui consiste à fournir à la machine des données étiquetées X, Y (labelled dataset) et la machine apprend alors le lien qui uni X et Y.
- Le Unsupervised Learning (apprentissage non supervisé) qui consiste à laisser la machine apprendre des structures dans les données X sans lui montrer Y
- Le Reinforcement Learning (Apprentissage par renforcement) qui consiste à récompenser la machine lorsqu’elle entreprend des bonnes actions pour qu’elle apprenne comment agir en autonomie.
Le Deep Learning (apprentissage profond) est une technique au sein même du machine Learning qui vise à développer des réseaux de neurones extrêmement larges pour en utilisant des milliards de données dans le but de dépasser les compétences humaines.

Why machine learning is important?

Machine learning might just be one of the most important fields of science that we are just moving towards. It differs from other science in the sense that this is one of the one domains where the input and output are not directly correlated and neither do we provide the input for every task that the machine will perform. It is more about mimicking how humans think and solving real world problems like humans without actually the intervention of humans. It focuses on developing computer programs that can be taught to grown and change when exposed to data.

In 2018 he released the first version of his incredible online book, interpretable machine learning. Interpretability is often a deciding factor when a machine learning (ML) model is used in a product, a decision process, or in research. Interpretability methods can be used to discover knowledge, to debug or justify the model and its predictions, and to control and improve the model, reason about potential bias in models as well as increase the social acceptance of models. But Interpretability methods can also be quite esoteric, add an additional layer of complexity and potential pitfalls and requires expert knowledge to understand. Is it even possible to understand complex models or even humans for that matter in any  meaningful way?

There are certain tasks where human outperform computers such as image recognition, cognitive thinking, creativity, driving cars etc. Machine learning is a sub domain of artificial intelligence where set of statistical and neural network based algorithms are used for training a computer in doing a smart task. Deep learning is all about neural networks. Deep learning is considered to be a sub field of machine learning. Pytorch and Tensorflow are two popular frameworks that can be used in doing deep learning. 
Data science on the other hand a field where data is used to generate business insights. It can use machine learning techniques but data science can be done without using machine learning as well. One can use Microsoft excel to draw insights from data. Visualization and BI tools such as tableau and power BI can be used to plot powerful business reports that can give lots of insights about a business.

In this lecture, DeepMind Research Scientist James Martens covers the fundamentals of gradient-based optimization methods, and their application to training neural networks. Major topics include gradient descent, momentum methods, 2nd-order methods, and stochastic methods. James analyzes these methods through the interpretive framework of local 2nd-order approximations.

Speaker Bio: 

James Martens is a Research Scientist at DeepMind working on the fundamentals of deep learning including optimization, initialization, and regularization. Before that he received his BMath from the University of Waterloo, and did his Masters and PhD at University of Toronto, coadvised by Geoff Hinton and Rich Zemel. During his PhD he helped revive interest in deep neural network training by showing how deep networks could be effectively trained using pure optimization methods (which has now become the standard approach).

About the lecture series: 

The Deep Learning Lecture Series is a collaboration between DeepMind and the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence. Over the past decade, Deep Learning has evolved as the leading artificial intelligence paradigm providing us with the ability to learn complex functions from raw data at unprecedented accuracy and scale. Deep Learning has been applied to problems in object recognition, speech recognition, speech synthesis, forecasting, scientific computing, control and many more. The resulting applications are touching all of our lives in areas such as healthcare and medical research, human-computer interaction, communication, transport, conservation, manufacturing and many other fields of human endeavour. In recognition of this huge impact, the 2019 Turing Award, the highest honour in computing, was awarded to pioneers of Deep Learning.

In this lecture series, research scientists from leading AI research lab, DeepMind, deliver 12 lectures on an exciting selection of topics in Deep Learning, ranging from the fundamentals of training neural networks via advanced ideas around memory, attention, and generative modelling to the important topic of responsible innovation."

In this case it makes sense to train a model and save it to a file so that later on while making predictions you can just load that model from a file and you don't need to train it every time. Pickle and sklearn joblib modules can be used for this purpose. Joblib seems to be more efficient with big numpy arrays hence it is preferred when you have many numpy objects involved in your training step.

*https://bit.ly/3BeLEml

So What Is MLOps?

A group of Google researchers put out a paper titled Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt. This paper pointed out a growing problem that many companies might have been ignoring.

Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. [D. Sculley, Gary Holt, etc]

Another way the researchers put this in a follow-up presentation was that launching a rocket was easy, but ongoing operations afterwards was hard. Back then, the concept of DevOps was still coming into its own, but these engineers and researchers realized that there were many more complications in terms of deploying a machine learning model vs. deploying code.

This is when the popularity of machine learning platforms began to rise. Eventually, many of these platforms adopted the term MLOps to explain the service they were providing.

Com a quantidade de dados disponível sobre qualquer assunto hoje em dia, essa área está crescendo muito. Diversas empresas estão implantando aplicações de ML para melhorar seus negócios. 

Algoritmos de ML são classificados em supervisionados - nos quais se dá os exemplos com as 'respostas certas' - e não-supervisionados - nos quais não se dá as respostas certas. Entre os supervisionados existem os problemas de *regressão*, nos quais se quer prever um valor - por exemplo, o preço de um apartamento - e problemas de *classificação*, nos quais se quer prever uma categoria - por exemplo, se você vai ou não curtir um filme.

Em ML acontece uma espécie de aprendizado por exemplos. Quanto mais exemplos se dá para um algoritmo de aprendizado, melhor serão os resultados. Uma aplicação direta que eu comento no vídeo é a do Netflix. Quanto mais exemplos de filmes ou séries você curte, ou não curte, melhor o algoritmo fica em prever o que você gosta ou não gosta.  

Obviamente que aqui não falo em profundidade sobre o tema mas apenas toco nele, dando alguns exemplos e falando sobre as diferentes categorias de algoritmos de ML, e comparando com a programação tradicional. 

Em próximos vídeos pretendo falar sobre esse tópico com mais profundidade, dando exemplos na minha pesquisa de Engenharia de Software, e explicando melhor o funcionamento dos algoritmos.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, with Machine Learning, computers find insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.

Writing clean, maintainable Machine Learning code is harder. 

While consulting on numerous AI audio/music projects, I noticed that data scientists generally do a pretty good job in R&D, but then struggle to convert scrappy code into well-written ready-for-production code. 

To address this issue, I’m publishing a new series called “Uncle Bob’ SOLID Principles for Machine Learning Engineers”.

In this series, you can learn how to use fundamental clean code principles introduced by the legendary software engineer Uncle Bob (SOLID), in order to design your ML code. 

Adhering to SOLID principles, will make your ML pipelines easy to understand, flexible, and maintainable.  

In the first video of the series, I provide an overview of the course and introduce the SOLID principles.

What is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, with Machine Learning, computers find insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process. While the concept of Machine Learning(ML) has been around for a long time (think of the WWII Enigma Machine), the ability to automate the application of complex mathematical calculations to Big Data has been gaining momentum over the last several years. At a high level, Machine Learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently and through iterations.  Basically, applications learn from previous computations and transactions and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable and informed results.

How does Machine Learning work?
Machine Learning is, undoubtedly, one of the most exciting subsets of Artificial Intelligence. It completes the task of learning from data with specific inputs to the machine. It’s important to understand what makes Machine Learning work and, thus, how it can be used in the future. The Machine Learning process starts with inputting training data into the selected algorithm. Training data being known or unknown data to develop the final Machine Learning algorithm. The type of training data input does impact the algorithm, and that concept will be covered further momentarily. To test whether this algorithm works correctly, new input data is fed into the Machine Learning algorithm. The prediction and results are then checked. If the prediction is not as expected, the algorithm is re-trained multiple numbers of times until the desired output is found. This enables the Machine Learning algorithm to continually learn on its own and produce the most optimal answer that will gradually increase in accuracy over time.

Prezentacja odbyła się podczas spotkania PyWaw #64 (09.01.2017) - http://www.pywaw.org/64/

PyWaw (http://pywaw.org) to cykliczne spotkania pasjonatów języka programowania Python z Warszawy i okolic. Projekt ten skierowany jest zarówno do studentów stołecznych uczelni, profesjonalnych deweloperów oraz wszystkich tych, którzy swoją przygodę z Pythonem dopiero zaczynają. Celem naszych spotkań jest wymiana doświadczenia pomiędzy programistami, integracja pythonowego środowiska Warszawy oraz propagowanie Pythona jako uniwersalnego języka programowania. Spotkania PyWaw odbywają się w każdy drugi lub trzeci poniedziałek miesiąca."

Abstrakt: 
Wykład będzie kontynuacją mojego wystąpienia na Bydgoszcz JUG meetup #18: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb67Lfq1igM

Wtedy mówiłem dość oględnie o tym, czym jest uczenie maszynowe i czego za jego pomocą dokonano ostatnimi czasy. Tym razem skupię się na prezentacji podstawowych narzędzi wygodnych w prototypowaniu modeli uczenia maszynowego, przedstawię kody rozwiązujące przykładowe zagadnienia dla danych tabelarycznych i obrazów i wskażę linki do miejsc przydatnych w dalszej nauce.

Patryk po obronie doktoratu z matematyki pracował jakiś czas na uczelni. Potem postanowił spróbować swoich sił w uczeniu maszynowym. Został data scientistem w deepsense.ai, uczestniczył w projektach dotyczących m.in. kryminologii i medycyny. Od roku prowadzi również warsztaty i wykłady z uczenia maszynowego dla firm i uczelni na całym świecie. Od stycznia 2019 pomaga w rozkręcaniu biura deepsense.ai w Bydgoszczy"

Featuring Chris Morris (iOS Developer) &
Nic Ollis (Solutions Architect/ML Expert)

Here’s the deal - a product owner knows that he wants Machine Learning in the company’s next digital product. It’s all the rage, after all, and everyone is talking about it. He approaches his developer. The developer brings in the Machine Learning expert. Here’s how that conversation goes.
Things you’ll learn from this webinar.
When is machine learning right for a product and when does it not make sense?
What does the product owner need to consider before bringing machine learning into their digital product?
What questions should the developer and expert ask of the product owner before getting started?
How does the developer go about building ML into the product?
From an overall perspective, what aspects of ML does everyone get wrong, and how can teams approach ML in the best way possible?"

In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.

This game fits best for...
- People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work
- Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids
- Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding
- Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time’ (although we believe you shouldn’t feel guilty at all while playing games!)
- Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun
- Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it
- People who like smart cats"

So this trailer was only released yesterday, but surprisingly it was only in 1080p 25 frames per second.  It looked great of course, but we thought it was a good candidate for an upscale.  I think the results are great!  We also interpolated the footage from 25 frames to 60fps.  We hope you enjoy the vid!

Abstract:
The introduction of artificial intelligence has given us the ability to build predictive systems with unprecedented accuracy. Machine learning is being used in virtually all areas in one way or another, due to its extreme effectiveness. One such area where predictive systems have gained a lot of popularity is the prediction of football match results. This paper demonstrates our work on the building of a generalized predictive model for predicting the results of the English Premier League. Using feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, we create a feature set for determining the most important factors for predicting the results of a football match, and consequently create a highly accurate predictive system using machine learning. We demonstrate the strong dependence of our models’ performances on important features. Our best model using gradient boosting achieved a performance of 0.2156 on the ranked probability score (RPS) metric for game weeks 6 to 38 for the English Premier League aggregated over two seasons (2014–2015 and 2015–2016), whereas the betting organizations that we consider (Bet365 and Pinnacle Sports) obtained an RPS value of 0.2012 for the same period. Since a lower RPS value represents a higher predictive accuracy, our model was not able to outperform the bookmaker’s predictions, despite obtaining promising results."

Apa itu Scikit-Learn?

Scikit-Learn merupakan module dalam pemrograman Python yang memfasilitasi kita untuk mengerjakan berbagai machine learning project. Awalnya Scikit-Learn ini digarap sebagai bagian dari Google Summer of Code projec pada tahun 2007. Istilah Scikit sendiri merupakan kependekan dari SciPy Toolkits; karena memang project ini diperuntukkan sebagai extension untuk SciPy yang merupakan Scientific module dalam pemrograman python. Code base dari project ini lalu ditulis ulang dan mulai dibentuk tim khusus untuk mengembangkan project ini dengan lebih serius. Di awal tahun 2010, project Scikit-Learn ini dirilis ke publik dan berhasil menarik banyak contributor yang akhirnya menjadikan project ini terus berkembang sampai saat ini. Bahkan di tahun 2012, Scikit-Learn dikenal sebagai machine learning library yang paling populer dan well maintained.

VRST 2021
Session: Paper 4: Interaction Design

Abstract
Interactive Machine Learning offers a method for designing movement interaction that supports creators in implementing even complex movement designs in their immersive applications by simply performing them with their bodies. We introduce a new tool, InteractML, and an accompanying ideation method, which makes movement interaction design faster, adaptable and accessible to creators of varying experience and backgrounds, such as artists, dancers and independent game developers. The tool is specifically tailored to non-experts as creators configure and train machine learning models via a node-based graph and VR interface, requiring minimal programming. We aim to democratise machine learning for movement interaction to be used in the development of a range of creative and immersive applications.

How cool is that?! In this talk I'll briefly introduce you to the open source community growing around biosensor devices. 
I will explain briefly what biosensors are. What kinds are available to consumers and engineers. What sensors do I have myself? How to obtain the data from them. 
For the latter part I will introduce the open source BrainFlow library, for which I am a voluntary open source developer. It is a fast performing c++ library that's easy to use, can be deployed anywhere and has many language bindings, including Python and Julia. BrainFlow allows anyone with a biosensor to extract their own data with little hassle and build applications in their favorite programming language.
I will show code examples for how to obtain data from such biosensors, using Julia and BrainFlow. I specifically demonstrate gesture predictions using myo-electric muscle sensors. This topic I investigated for building open source bionic arm control systems. I would like to do a live demo, or at least show videos of the live data streaming and machine learning predictions. You can control real devices with these algorithms, like bionic arms, but I have also used it to play video games.
The live data processing, data streaming and machine learning predictions need to be as fast as possible, so I wrote all my code in Julia to show it is performant enough for this task.

Matthijs Cox : A physicist who loves to code. I taught myself data science, software development and neurotechnology. I learned all about biosensors and neurotechnology as founder of the Symbionic Project where we tried to create more affordable bionic arms.
Currently I am a product architect at ASML, developing numerical computing applications. We struggle a lot with the two language problem at ASML. In order to solve this problem I discovered Julia about two years ago. Julia is now my favorite programming language.

Artificial intelligence is a technology which enables a machine to simulate human behavior. Machine learning is a subset or a part of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past Experiences or data's gathered from those experiences  without programming explicitly. The goal is to make a smart computer system like humans to solve complex problems.
AI is an automated decision-making system, which continuously learn, adapt, suggest and take actions automatically. 
At the core, they require algorithms which are able to learn from their experience. This is where Machine Learning comes into the picture.
Artificial intelligence is widely used to provide personalized recommendations to people,  based for example on their previous searches and purchases or other online behavior. AI is hugely important in commerce:   optimizing products, planning inventory, logistics etc.
Reactive Machines:
Reactive machines are basic in that they do not store ‘memories’ or use past experiences to determine future actions. They simply perceive the world and react to it. IBM’s Deep Blue, which defeated chess grand master Kasporov,  is a reactive machine that sees the pieces on a chess board and reacts to them. It cannot refer to any of its prior experiences, and cannot improve with practice.
Limited Memory :
Limited Memory machines can retain data for a short period of time. While they can use this data for a specific period of time, 
they cannot add it to a library of their experiences. Many self-driving cars use Limited Memory technology: they store data such as the recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of such cars, the speed limit, and other information that can help them navigate roads.
Theory of Mind :
Psychology tells us that people have thoughts, emotions, memories, and mental models that drive their behavior. Theory of Mind researchers hope to build computers that imitate our mental models, by forming representations about the world,  and about other agents and entities in it. One goal of these researchers is to build computers that relate to humans and perceive human intelligence and  how people’s emotions are impacted by events and the environment. While plenty of computers use models, a computer with a ‘mind’ does not yet exist.
Self-Awareness :
Self-aware machines are the stuff of science fiction, though many AI enthusiasts believe them to be the ultimate goal of AI development. 
Even if a machine can operate as a person does, for example by preserving itself, predicting its own needs and demands, and relating to others as an equal, the question of whether a machines can become truly self-aware, or ‘conscious’, is best left for philosophers. Machine learning : Types of Machine learning : Supervised Learning :
Supervised learning is one of the most basic types of machine learning. In this type, the machine learning algorithm is trained on labeled data. 
Even though the data needs to be labeled accurately for this method to work, supervised learning is extremely powerful when used in the right circumstances.  In supervised learning, the ML algorithm is given a small training dataset to work with. This training dataset is a smaller part of the bigger dataset and serves to  give the algorithm a basic idea of the problem, solution, and data points to be dealt with. The training dataset is also very similar to the final dataset in its  characteristics and provides the algorithm with the labeled parameters required for the problem. The algorithm then finds relationships between the parameters given, essentially establishing a cause and effect relationship between the variables in the datasets.  At the end of the training, the algorithm has an idea of how the data works and the relationship between the input and the output. This solution is then deployed for use with the final dataset, which it learns from in the same way as the training dataset.  This means that supervised machine learning algorithms will continue to improve even after being deployed, discovering new patterns and  relationships as it trains itself on new data. In supervised learning, the computer is taught by example. It learns from past data and applies the learning to present data to predict future events. 
In this case, both input and desired output data provide help to the prediction of future events."

📌 According to a 📃 survey, an average of 2.5 quintillion bytes of 📊 data is being generated every day. To handle this massive amount of data, we use machine learning models to train a machine with specific data to make inferences.

📌 We can deploy ⚙️ Machine Learning models on the ☁️ cloud (like Azure) and integrate ML models with various cloud resources for 🚀 better results.

📌 Steps To Deploy A ML Model Using Azure ML Designer:
1) In the Create inference pipeline drop-down list, click a Real-time inference pipeline.
2) Rename the new pipeline to Predict Diabetes, Delete the diabetes dataset from the inference pipeline, and replace it with an Enter Data Manually module.
3) The inference pipeline includes the Evaluate Model module, which does not predict new data, so delete this module.
4) To limit the output to only the prediction and probability, delete the connection between the Score Model module and the Web Service Output, add an Execute Python Script module.
5) Verify your pipeline
6) After some time, we can see the inference pipeline is submitted successfully.
7) At the top right, click Deploy, and set up a new real-time endpoint named predict-diabetes on the inference cluster (ML-inference) you created
8) When the predict-diabetes endpoint opens, note the REST endpoint and Primary key on the Consume tab.

The visible universe represents the parts of space that we can see using telescopes. Yet, scientists and explorers do believe that the universe may be larger than that.

To date, scientists have explored roughly only 4% of the visible universe that is made up of planets, stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects that astronomers and scientists can see and are aware of. Rest 96% is still left unexplored.

Understanding Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:
Artificial Intelligence or the shorter and cooler term AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machines that exhibit traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

Machine learning is a specialized branch in the AI domain that deals with training machines to develop intelligence that can enable them to do complex tasks by using their intelligence. Machine learning algorithms use tons of data to help machines get familiar with diverse scenarios that they can face. It enables machines to learn from their training experience and use them in real-life scenarios.
***We got our first black-hole image using CHIRP (Continous High-Resolution Image Reconstruction using Patch Priors) Algorithm. CHIRP is a Bayesian algorithm used to perform deconvolution on images created in radio astronomy. The development of CHIRP involved a large team of researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. The CHIRP used the image data from the Event Horizon Telescopes which was too large and this is where image processing had to be done. Scientists used Numpy, pandas, and other Python libraries to scale down the data, data correlation, and calibrations. ML was also used in image analysis.

Aditya 369 Film Directed by Veteran Singeetam Srinivasa Rao and Produced by Anita Krishna on Sridevi Movies Banner, Music Composed by Illayaraja. #Aditya369 #NandamuriBalakrishna #TeluguFullMovies

Aditya 369 Full Length Movie Description : This movie begins with a scientist Prof. Ramdas (Tinnu Anand) doing vigorous experiments to invent a 'Time Machine' at his home laboratory. After tremendous effort eventually he becomes successful. His daughter Hema (played by Mohini) and her fiancée Krishna Kumar (Nandamuri Balakrishna) accidentally get into the time machine and visit the past (time of Krishnadeva Raya's Empire). At another instance, the couple gets ended up in a fictional 'Future' set up by the 'Time Machine' where in, the world is about to get destroyed through radiation effect after the end of Third World War. This movie has been developed and was inspired on the lines of ""back to the future"" movies but is very well made with regards to originality & regionalism. The story revolves around one more important aspect, the Krishnadeva Raya's Empire - diamond in a highly secured museum. A high profile thief Raja Verma (Amrish Puri) has a queer hobby of burglary of expensive diamonds from all over the world museums. He makes an attempt to rob the diamond in the present time, which was witnessed by a school kid - Hema's cousin (Tarun Kumar) - on his school excursion to the museum. He is trapped inside the museum and happens to see the robbery happening in front of his eyes and the kid manages to escape from the robbers and gets rescued from the museum by Krishna Kumar. The rest of the plot has many twists and turns. This contributes to the film's visual treat and laugh riot.

I address (1) is it trending downward? (2) Will it be automated and (3) Will there be jobs available? 

I've gotten quite a few versions of similar questions: Is data science dying? Is the data science job market saturated? Is it too late to get into data science?

This is my (somewhat) thorough answer to these questions.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

TO BE CLEAR I still think it is possible for anyone to break into this field, but I also think it is important to set realistic expectations. 

Subscribe to the Newsletter here! https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter

1) Educational Burden - Data science is a multidisciplinary field. You need to learn computer science, coding, and subject area knowledge. You really need to invest many hours into this endeavor. 
- Project Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AReJn7nZfqOKLZ3IpKj7fwc
- Kaggle Courses (Free): https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview
- 365 Data Science (57% Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY

2) Market Saturation - There is a huge supply of entry level data scientists. With more people, that means the probability of landing a data science job is lower. 

3) Data Science isn't a good fit for you - It takes a lot of time and dedication to break into this field. It helps to be very passionate about the work. There are other great careers like software engineering that have a lower barrier to entry where you make similar income (if not more).

4) Ambiguity - Data science job postings are very unclear / unreliable.

5) Continued learning - You need to be adaptable in your role. It takes habits or huge motivation to keep studying. 

Congratulations! If you made it this far you likely have one of the most important skills for breaking into this field. 

That skill is GRIT.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

How to Become a Data Scientist in India? Let's find out! In this video we’ll look at the latest research to help you assess your chances of landing a data scientist job in India. 

We’ll focus on the education and qualifications you need to become a data scientist eligible for the job at any company. To learn all that and some extra tips that will help you get a data science job in India, watch this video!

A recent report by The Hindu states that there are an estimated 97,000 data analytics job openings in India (Bengaluru accounts for 24% of these job openings, while Delhi/NCR for 22%). 

Since the data science field is progressing at an extremely fast rate, the huge demand for data science talent, especially in the Technology/IT and Industrial domain, can hardly catch up with the supply of skilled data scientists. That’s why it doesn’t come as a surprise that a significant part of the data scientists in India (more than 40%) have received a ‘data scientist’ job title within the last 24 months. 

So, becoming a data scientist in India seems like a truly golden opportunity. Let’s see what that means in terms of salaries!

According to upgrad.com, “data scientist” is the highest paying job in India. To be more precise, the average data scientist salary listed on Glassdoor is above 1,000,000 rupees per year and it could go up to 2,000,000 rupees for more experienced candidates.

Of course, corporations based in large cities like Mumbai and Bangalore offer higher salaries. But keep in mind that this may soon change. Many international companies prefer to open an office in Hyderabad, as it’s much more affordable. No wonder giants like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and P&G already call Hyderabad their home. And that translates into even more career opportunities for data scientists in India...

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

Is this not enough to know more about data science! In the world of data space, the era of Big Data emerged when organizations are dealing with petabytes and exabytes of data. It became very tough for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when popular frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus is on processing the data. And here Data Science plays a big role. Nowadays the growth of data science has been increased in various ways and so one should be ready for the future by learning what data science is and how can we add value to it.

Ele faz um histórico da aplicação das tecnologias na astronomia e como a grande quantidade de dados que estão sendo adquiridos agora e no futuro próximo poderá auxiliar na resolução de grandes problemas astronômicos. Ele nos dá um belo exemplo de aplicação do data science na definição do que são estrelas e galáxias que estão muito longe, já que aparentemente todos esses objetos são pontos de luz, e essa distinção é fundamental para estudos relacionados por exemplo com a energia escura. Um papo muito bom, espero que gostem!!!!

👉 Yesi nos compartió, desde su experiencia, lo que todo científico o científica de datos necesita conocer y hacer para no morir en el intento: creer en los datos. Así de simple, pero nada fácil. ¿Por qué? Porque es necesario mejorar tanto las habilidades técnicas, como siempre tener fundamentos en matemáticas y estadísticos.

Yesi, apasionada de lo que hace, recomendó siempre confiar en lo que se sabe y sustentar todos los hallazgos y resultados para que sean creíbles y aplicables. ""Usar un modelo que sustente cada propuesta y poder interpretar así los resultados"".

Data is what makes testing hypotheses and running experiments possible. But just like any tool, data needs to be used correctly. It’s important to not only know how the data is collected but also how to analyze it after it’s been collected.  In this video, we explore why data is critically important to the scientific process, what makes good data, and how to use data correctly. We’ll also look at what makes the OOI (Ocean Observatories Initiative) so revolutionary when it comes to data collection.

Detailed video description! (timeline can be found in comments)

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

Data Science é o estudo disciplinado dos dados e informações inerentes ao negócio e todas as visões que podem cercar um determinado assunto.

É uma ciência que estuda as informações, seu processo de captura, transformação, geração e, posteriormente, análise de dados. A ciência de dados envolve diversas disciplinas:

- Computação;
- Estatística;
- Matemática;
- Conhecimento do Negócio.
 
DATA SCIENTIST OU CIENTISTA DE DADOS?

Já que definimos Data Science/Ciência de Dados, porquê não definirmos o profissional Cientista de Dados/Data Scientist?

O cientista de dados é um profissional multidisciplinar, responsável por realizar o processo citado no tópico Data Science acima. 

Ou seja, é responsável por transformar dados em informações ou produtos de informações dentro de uma corporação.

Além disso, ele também deve ser responsável pela formulação dos problemas, escolha de modelos de simulação e estatística e entrega dos produtos de dados.

The Titanic Project Walk-through - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3FBJdiExcg&ab_channel=KenJee

Project 1: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - This shows that you can clearly tell a story with your data. It also shows that you can collect, clean, and perform feature engineering. I recommend scraping your data or collecting it from an open api.

Project 2: Classification problem - With these projects you are predicting a binary or categorical outcome. An example would be the titanic dataset where you predict if people would have survived the crash. 

Project 3: A regression problem - In these types of analyses, you try to predict a continuous outcome. An example would be predicting how many likes a youtube video would get ;).

Project 4: A clustering problem - With this we use algorithms to understand which data points are related to eachother. 

Project 5: An advanced topic (NLP, Computer Vision, Deep Neural Nets) - These projects allow you to specialize and show off your skills!

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

665,Niklas Steenfatt,Wie wird man Data Scientist?,2020-08-16,t0r0g,59951,2888,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oO-blF4-od4/maxresdefault.jpg,1920,1080,Education,wie wird man data scientist|was ist data science|data science was ist das|was macht ein data scientist|data science studium,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzsfkUFa1_4F4cZeSLv5dFQ,"Data Science, was ist das überhaupt? Was macht ein Data Scientist? Was muss man lernen, wenn man eine Data Science Karriere anstrebt? Diese Fragen beantworte ich im heutigen Video.

Dem Beruf des Data Scientists wurde schon 2009 von Hal Varian und einige Jahre später dem Harvard Business Review eine glorreiche Zukunft vorhergesagt. Diese Vorhersage ist eingetreten, Daten spielen eine wichtigere Rolle denn je, und Data Scientists sind auf dem Arbeitsmarkt extrem gefragt.

Data Science ist allerdings ein recht allgemeiner Begriff (""Wissenschaft mit Daten""), der sich in viele Unterbereiche aufgliedern lässt, zum Beispiel: Messung & Metriken, Strategie, Vorhersagen (Time Series Analysis), Korrelationen, Experimente (AB-Tests), Data Engineering (Logging, ETL-Pipelines), Modellierung, Optimierung, Visualisierung, Maschinelles Lernen, Künstliche Intelligenz.

Hinzu kommt, dass man sich mit jedem dieser Bereiche auf einer von drei Stufen beschäftigen kann:
1) Grundlagenforschung (Level: Professor)
2) Angewandte Forschung bzw. Core Data Science (Level: PhD)
3) Anwendung bzw. Product Data Science (Level: Bachelor/Master/PhD)

Um als typischer Data Scientist in einer Firma zu arbeiten, sollte man mathematische Vorkenntnisse haben. Bewerber kommen üblicherweise aus Feldern wie: Informatik, Physik, Mathematik, Wirtschaftswissenschaften, Maschinenbau, Psychologie, ...

Vor allem die Statistik spielt in fast allen Bereichen eine immense Rolle. Darüber hinaus ist ein guter Data Scientist mit Python und/oder R bewandert und hat gute Kommunikationsfähigkeiten.

Peter Wang (Gründer Anaconda) beantwortet die Frage ""Was ist Data Science"" so: data science is a literacy, not a job. Ihm zufolge entwickelt sich Data Science mehr und mehr zu einer allgemein notwendigen Fähigkeit, die keinem einzelnen Berufszweig zuzuordnen ist.

Wenn du anfangen möchtest, dich mit Data Science zu beschäftigen, sind Bücher, Videos oder Vorlesungen zu Statistik und Python eine gute Wahl. Für eine umfangende Einführung empfehle ich Onlinekurse, z.B. den genannten von Coursera, siehe Link weiter unten.

Dan Hammer is looking to turn this paradigm on its head, as he takes a high-tech approach to preserving the environment by using data science and satellite imagery to monitor and protect forests all around the globe. 
 Dan Hammer received 2017 Pritzker Award for his work to make environmental information more accessible to journalists. He earned his PhD in Environmental Economics from UC Berkeley, where he was a Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. Dan works at an environmental and tech nonprofit that he founded alongside two other Berkeley alumni, including the former CEO of The Nature Conservancy and The Moore Foundation. He previously served as a Senior Policy Advisor on data infrastructure in the Obama White House, as well as a Presidential Innovation Fellow at NASA. Dan was the Chief Data Scientist at the World Resources Institute, where he co-founded Global Forest Watch -- an online platform to monitor deforestation from satellite imagery. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx"

Why Learn Hadoop? Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

In this first part I cover using abstract classes and protocols to better separate the various aspects of the application, and I talk about function composition as a generic solution to dealing with data pipelines.

Thanks to Mark Todisco for helping out with preparing the example. The code I worked on in this video is available here: https://github.com/ArjanCodes/2021-data-science-refactor.

#DataScience #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #DataScienceCareer#DataScienceJobs #ArtificialIntelligenceCareer #MachineLearningCareer #CareerAdvice

If you want to start AI tomorrow there are three things I would say that you should have. One is figuring out what kind of learning do you like? Do you like to learn from a book or do you like watching videos? I like watching videos. When you’re watching videos are you taking notes? Those kinda things, figure out your learning curve, how are you going to do that. Second thing is, find more friends. You can find people in the forums, you can talk to them and see and have this kind of a community wherein you can go to; you can go to data science meetups and meet people who are also the same, following the same paths, struggling to learn, etc.
Then the third thing is, you’re having people who have already gone through this. Have some mentors. I think that really helps a lot. Talking to them will make a lot more sense to you; you would also know where you’re going wrong and you can also say that this is the path I want to learn. There is going to be a lot of clarity which you’re going to get. And the fourth thing that I am going to say is this – Do not get stuck in theory. It has to be hands-on. Unless and until you run your first model, understand and run your first model, it’s ok even if it’s a blackbox, just run it. Even if you don’t understand python, just run it. Download a notebook and just run it on a Google Collab or whatever it is, but just run it. It’s OK. Be more hands-on. Only then you’ll learn a lot more. So, 3 things: Figure out the course, whatever you want to do; have a support structure of friends, forums, etc have couple of mentors or a mentor who is going to help you out and the fourth thing, Be HandsOn, do more projects. I would say that breaking into data science is just equivalent to breaking into software engineering for someone who does not have that kind of background. To split it down into atomic parts, I would say that you need to be passionate about that field, you need to get a strong hold of the basics, basic technical skills that you require for that field. Apart from that you should probably choose an industry in which you have an inherent interest. For example if you’re interested in Finance, you should look for roles in the financial industry as a data scientist. And apart from that you should have a knack of augmenting your knowledge regularly because it is an ever evolving field so everyday you have new research papers being published, the amazing research that is happening in the AI and the community. And there a new tools that you get to use for implementing your solutions. You should have that sort of curiosity and that sort of drive in you to learn something new each day and keep augmenting your knowledge. If you feel you identify with this kind of a skill set you’re on the right path of transitioning into data science. The thing people still have confusion that anyone can be a data scientist or not. So I will say anyone can be a data scientist. Even I'm mentoring one student, he has absolutely no background of maths and coding and he is doing fine, very good in the data science track."

Is Data Science really is a rising career? And if it is – why and for how long? The answer to the first question is simple: yes, data science is without a doubt a rising career. The reason is simple: data science operates under the same supply and demand economic principles as the rest of the business world. To learn more about how that secures the data scientist career and high salary ($100,000+), watch this video!

According to Glassdoor, 2016 was the first year in which “data scientist” was the ‘Best job’ on the market. And after that? Well, it was in the lead in 2017, 2018, and 2019 as well! With a mean base salary of more than $100,000, being a data scientist seems like the dream job of this century. But why is that?

Of course, like any other business-related phenomenon, it follows the basic laws of economics – supply and demand. The demand for data science professionals is very high, while the supply is too low. 

Think about computer science years ago. The internet was becoming a “thing” and people were making serious cash off it. Everybody wanted to become a programmer, a web-designer or anything, really, that would allow them to be in the computer science industry. Salaries were terrific and it was exceptional to be there. As time passed by, the salaries plateaued as the supply of CS guys and girls started to catch up with the demand. That said, the industry is still above average in terms of pay.

The same thing is happening to the data science industry right now. Demand is really high, while supply is still low. And, as stated in an extensive joint research performed by IBM, Burning Glass Technologies, and Business-Higher Education Forum, this tendency will continue to be strong for the years to come.

Data & code used in this Tutorial: https://github.com/KeithGalli/pandas
Python Pandas Documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

Let me know if you have any questions!

In this video we walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library. We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)

I realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.

It's also surprisingly simple, but often poorly explained. Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

What are the best data science degrees to get hired? We did a lot of research and we can now share with you the best data science degrees! 

To get into Data Science, you need a degree that signals potential employers you are the qualified candidate they’re looking for. We have conducted several studies on this topic to determine what are the best degrees for an aspiring Data Scientist. So, in this video, we’ll go over the level, discipline and university rank you should be looking at when deciding what degree is worth pursuing or if your current degree is suitable for the field.

Our results show that virtually all data scientists have graduated from an institution of higher education. This includes Bachelors, Masters, MBAs, and Ph.Ds. However, some degrees seem to be much more popular than others.

In fact, only around 2% of all data scientists in our sample owned an MBA, but that’s not entirely surprising. If you decide to do an MBA, chances are you’re not aiming at the hands-on technical data scientist role on the team. 

Bachelors, Masters, and Ph.Ds round up roughly 95% of the data, with 75% being split among Masters and PhDs. This means that roughly 3 out of every 4 data scientists have at least a master’s degree. So, yes, going for a graduate program is highly recommended. 

Of course, if you think a B.A. is as high as you want to go, there is no need to be discouraged. Nearly 20% of the data scientists in our sample had only completed an undergraduate prior to entering the field. And while this number is not high, the percentage of data scientists holding only a Bachelor’s degree has been steadily growing over the last three years.  

This is a refreshing indicator that shows employers are starting to value skills over years of schooling. In other words, a qualified candidate today has a higher chance of breaking into the field, compared to two years ago.

SQL is one of the fundamental programming languages you need to learn to work with databases. When you are a data scientist in a company and you need data to perform your analysis, you usually have two options: extract it on your own or contact the IT team. Of course, the ability to extract your own data is an extremely valuable skill to have. In this course, we will teach you everything you need to know in terms of database management and creating SQL queries.

7:17 Why MySQL?
9:15 Introduction to databases
13:59 SQL as a declarative language

Whether you are working in business intelligence (BI), data science, database administration, or back-end development, you will have to retrieve information from a server storing large amounts of data. To achieve this, you need SQL. The relational database management system we chose for this course is MySQL. We did that because MySQL is open-source, reliable, and mature. In one of the videos of this section, we will provide you with step-by-step guidance when you install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench. The introductory part of this course pays significant attention to database theory. You will learn the meaning of terms like database, data table, data entity, record, field, relation, and more.

Why learn Python?

Programmers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license.

#DataScience #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #DataScienceCareer #DataScienceJobs #ArtificialIntelligenceCareer #MachineLearningCareer #CareerAdvice 

So I think there are a lot of different types of career opportunities for people interested in data science. Right from data engineers to ML engineers to data scientists to machine learning scientists to data analysts and even business analysts. And there is often confusing which role to pick. People often say I come from a certain background and not sure which path to take and I think having a mentor really helps in these situations to figure out what opportunities to pursue given a particular background and what is the course of action to be taken to reach there. While a lot of data is available online, in fact, to pick up data science, mentorships even helps to understand you know keep track of progress and get a more high-level idea on what are the kind of project you want to do if you want to land in a certain kind of job and also what are the kind of domains you want to pick based on your experience. So I think having a mentor and having a little bit of that extra advice goes a long way in making the right decision.
So there are multiple types of roles in the data science industry and there is a lot of confusion around them, so let me clear that out. Data science is a multidisciplinary field which involves skills from statistics, probability, machine learning, software engineering and combinations of these result in different titles and roles which might confuse people. Broadly there are roles like data engineer, infrastructure engineer, so their roles are not typically data science roles but they are more of a support system around data scientists. They help data scientist do their job. So when it comes to data science there are three categories, even though there is still confusion around them but gradually some clarity is coming up. So data science role, there are three roles. The first role is a data analyst role, the data analyst is a person who is responsible for reporting, summarizing data, using basic statistics in SQL and Python to help business decision-makers take those decisions and also help data scientist do that projects. So typically this role is..companies do hire for these roles, almost every company hire for this kind of role. The second role is more of a data scientist which goes a little deeper into the problem. They work on problems like fraud detection, recommender system where they work with much more scientific rigor than a data analyst. The typical skills which are required to do this thing are statistics, programming languages, machine learning and etc. But these people don’t have a strong background in software engineering so in a product based setup they pair up with a machine learning engineer to put that model into production which brings me to the third part which is the machine learning engineer. Machine learning engineer is a person who has a strong foundation in software engineering but also understands machine learning so that they can put the, in a product based setup these people can put machine learning models into production integrate with the core software. So coming to the companies that hire for these kinds of roles, so companies are hiring for data analysts also, data scientists also, machine learning engineers also."

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

How IBM does data science consulting? In 2020 IBM does data science consulting by following their vetted best-practice framework. 

In this video, we will focus on a fascinating topic – the step-by-step process IBM’s data science team applies when working on a consulting project. We believe this overview can be highly beneficial for both experienced professionals and data science beginners.

We’ll explore a best-practice framework applied by one of the pioneer and leading companies in the field. This way, you’ll get an insider’s look at how a consulting project that involves data analysis and data science unfolds.

In addition, we’ll examine the results achieved in IBM’s data science consulting projects with major clients from different industries. Why is that important? Well, each of these initiatives serves as an invaluable lesson to the rest of the companies in the respective industry. If, for example, Carrefour managed to leverage AI to improve its supply chain processes, the rest of the global hypermarket chains would basically be obliged to follow, if they want to keep up.

Let’s get right in and outline the five stages of a data science consulting project. 

Stage one - engage the firm’s CTO.
Stage two - meet with the company’s SMEs and brainstorm.
Three – Data collection and modeling through coding sprints;
Four - Visualization and communication of findings;
And finally - Follow-up projects.

Each of these steps of the process is vital, so let me elaborate a bit further by describing them one by one in more detail. Enjoy the video!

Well I thought I’d share what a ‘typical day’ looks like for me.  

Whilst there really isn’t a typical day, this is a tiny insight into what I get up on most days while working from home. 

I work alongside a number of different teams including Sales, Product Management and Marketing to help clients make the best of their data. On this day I was focused on building a few new models, one to show to a client in the afternoon followed by a second one that I was demonstrating as part of a webinar.

About this course:
The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do. This field is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science practitioners and we will get an overview of what data science is today.

About the course 

Python has been one of the premier, flexible, and powerful open-source language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and has powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis. For over a decade, Python has been used in scientific computing and highly quantitative domains such as finance, oil and gas, physics, and signal processing. 

Edureka's Python Certification Training not only focuses on the fundamentals of Python, Statistics and Machine Learning but also helps one gain expertise in applied Data Science at scale using Python. The training is a step by step guide to Python and Data Science with extensive hands-on. The course is packed with several activity problems and assignments and scenarios that help you gain practical experience in addressing predictive modeling problems that would either require Machine Learning using Python. Starting from basics of Statistics such as mean, median and mode to exploring features such as Data Analysis, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Naive Bayes, Cross-Validation, Label Encoding, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines with a supporting example and exercise help you get into the weeds. 

Furthermore, you will be taught of Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence. You will be able to train your machine based on real-life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Edureka’s Python course will also cover both basic and advanced concepts of Python like writing Python scripts, sequence and file operations in Python. You will use libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit, and master concepts like Python machine learning, scripts, and sequence.

Why learn Python?

It's continued to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging programs is a breeze in Python with its built-in debugger. 

It runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license.

It has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that it is the "" Next Big Thing "" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.

How to get an entry-level data scientist job is a question we get a lot. So, we discuss how to get an entry-level data scientist job in this video. 

We’ll go over education, experience, skills and finish up with a cohesive plan about the steps you need to take to start your journey as an entry-level Data Scientist. Of course, all the information is based on empirical research, statements by employers in data science, and a dash of our personal experience.

In previous videos on our channel, we’ve discussed the best degree for an aspiring data scientist. To recap: any form of post-graduate degree in a quantitative field gives you a pretty good chance of success, with Computer Science being the most-represented major. 

Apart from an education, you also need some sort of experience credentials to your name. To understand the methodology we used, you can check out the article linked in the description. For reference, the results suggest that roughly 35% of current Data Scientists have already had a job in the same position. This means that the remaining 65% had a different occupation prior to that. Therefore, roughly 2 out of every 3 data scientists are on their first data scientist job in the field.

However, don’t expect to become a data scientist right after school. As little as 2% of all data scientists started off with no previous position on their resume. And even this number in itself sounded suspiciously *high* to us. Either way, to land even an entry-level position, you still need some previous experience elsewhere.

ازيكم

زي ما وعدتكم المرة اللي فاتت ان شاء الله المرة دي حنتكلم عن الفروق بين مجالات مسمياتها قريبة قوي من بعض و اللي هي
Big Data
Data Analysis
Data Science
و حنحاول ندي نبذة عن كل واحد فيهم و ايه المهارات المختلفة اللي محتاج تعرفها علشان تبتدي في المجال ده.

ايه هو ال Big Data؟
يمكن في الفترة الأخيرة مصطلح ال Big Data كان عليه دوشة كثير بالذات لما عمرو أديب قال تعريف عجيب ليه أظهره كأنه حاجة شريرة أو سيئة, و طبعاً التعريف ده للأسف ما كانش ليه أي علاقة بالواقع.
ال Big Data في النهاية هو مجال هندسي من مجالات هندسة البرمجيات, بيهدف في الأساس لبناء أنظمة تقدر تتعامل مع حجم البيانات الهائل, و لو أخدت بالك احنا هنا ما قلناش نوع التعامل ده ايه, احنا هنا بنتكلم في أساس أي تعامل مع البيانات و اللي بيبتدي عادة بالتخزين, و الأرشفة و البحث و القدرة على انك تعمل عمليات عليها. يعني علشان نقرب المفهوم, قاعدة البيانات اللي احنا كلنا متعودين عليها زي mySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server في النهاية بتخزن, و تفهرس و تتيح وسائل للتعامل مع البيانات نفسها, و ده نفس اللي بتعمله ال Big Data Systems برضه, لكن الفرق الأهم هو ان حجم البيانات ضخم جداً, و بالتالي البيانات دي مش متخزنة على سيرفر واحد مثلاً, بل ممكن تبقى عشرات بل مئات الآلاف من السيرفرات اللي كلها بتساهم في بناء نظام ال Big Data بتاعك.
من أشهر أنظمة ال Big Data و اللي يمكن أغلب الناس اللي في المجال ده بتستخدمه, هو مجموعة تقنيات Apache Hadoop و زي ما أكيد أخدت بالك اني قلت مجموعة تقنيات, و ده لأنه Hadoop ده تقدر تقول كده انه مظلة لمجموعة كبيرة جداً من التقنيات اللي كل حاجة فيها بتعمل وظيفة معينة و بتساعدك في سيناريوهات معينة.
يعني مثلاً, أول حاجة غالباً حتحتاجها في التعامل مع أي بيانات, هو انك تخزنها و تنظمها في حاجة زي ال File System اللي على جهازك, و هنا بيجي دور أول تقنية و هي HDFS  و ده اسم ال File System بتاع Hadoop و اللي يعتبر القاعدة الأساسية اللي بتني عليها كل التقنيات التانية, و ده اللي بيسمح بتخزين البيانات و الحفاظ عليها عن طريق ال Redundancy و يديلك abstraction بحيث ما تحتاجش تعرف تفاصيل كثير عن ازاي البيانات و فين البيانات متخزنة او على أي أجهزة
بعد ما خزنت البيانات, حتحتاج طريقة تقدر تكتب بيها برامج تشتغل على البيانات دي, و اللي هو بنسميه Programming Model, و ال Programming Model اللي بتستخدمه في ال Big Data يمكن اشهرهم على الاطلاق هو MapReduce و ده اللي بيخليك تقدر تكتب برامج, طبعاً ده موضوع كبير لوحده.طبعأً Hadoop فيه مكونات أساسية أكثر من كده بكثير, زي ZooKeeper و Yarn و فوق ده كله فيه تطبيقات مشهورة زي Hive و اللي بتخليك تقدر تعامل البيانات اللي على Hadoop كأنها قاعدة بيانات و تكلمها بلغة شبه ال SQL جداً اسمها HQL, و حاجات تانية زي Hbase و غيرها كثير جداً من التقنيات اللي لا يسع المجال دلوقتي اننا نتكلم فيها.
الفكرة لو بصيت على ده كله, حتكتشف انها في النهاية كلها ادوات و تقنيات للتعامل مع البيانات, لكن نوعية التعامل ده ايه مش مشكلة ال Big Data

نيجي لل Data Analysis و ال Data Science

علشان نفهم الاتنين, محتاجين الأول نوصل الفكرة ان ال Data Science هو مجال بيختص بكل ماله علاقة بالبيانات, سواء بيانات Structured أو لأ, سواء محتاجة شوية تجهيز الأول, الهدف الأساسي لل Data Scientist هو انه يبحث في البيانات عن الدرر, زي الأنماط اللي بتتكرر و اللي على أساسها ممكن نتوقع حاجة تحصل في المستقبل, و ده غالباً بيكون عن طريق تطوير Models و ال Models دي ممكن تكون مبنية على حاجات زي Mathematical models, Statistical models, Machine learning, deep learning كل دي طرق مختلفة لبناء ال models اللي حتساعده انه من خلال البيانات اللي معاه دلوقتي يقدر يتوقع حاجات تحصل في المستقبل. 
ال Data Scientist عمومأً بيبقى خلفيته رياضية أو احصائية مع ال Computer Science, و ده طبعاً بيخليهم نادرين و الطلب عليهم كثير لأن الخلطة دي من المهارات مش سهلة قوي.
و فيه مثل مشهور 

Data Scientist: A person who is better at Statistics than any Software Engineer, and better at Software Engineering than any Statistician

و أغلب الصناعات و المجالات اللي بتتعامل مع بيانات كثير بتحتاج ناس تقدر تطلعلهم النوع ده من ال insights من البيانات, زي المؤسسات المالية, و شركات السوشيال ميديا, و التسويق و المبيعات و غيرها من المجالات.

ال Data Analyst 
 هو شخص بيتعامل مع البيانات بشكل يومي و غالباً من خلال ادوات جاهزة, زي Tableu أو حتى Excel, الفكرة انه أغلب الوقت بيكون هدفه هو الوضع الحالي أكثر من ايه اللي حيحصل في المستقبل, يعني أسئلة زي احنا عملنا مبيعات النهاردة بكام, أو عندنا كام عميل جديد, أو السنة دي مقارنة بالسنة اللي فاتت عملنا فلوس قد ايه, كلها بيانات و أسئلة مهمة, لكن أغلبها بتكون اسئلة اجابتها موجودة في البيانات أو محتاجة عمليات احصائية بسيطة, مش بالضرورة يكون عنده خلفية برمجية, و ان كان من المتوقع انه يكون عنده القدرة على التعامل مع قواعد بيانات أو البرامج الخاصة بده, مع خلفية احصائية.
يعني لو حبينا نقول أكبر فرق بين ال Data Scientist و ال Data Analyst هو ان ال Data Scientist مشغول باستقراء المستقبل و ال Data Analyst مشغول بتقييم الواقع و الماضي.

ده كان موضوعنا الأسبوع ده, مستنيين مقترحاتكم و اسئلتكم, و ان شاء الله نرجعلكم بموضوع جديد قريب.

A lot of people seem to think that being hired as a Data Scientist means that you'll deploy Machine Learning models and research AI applications. But in many companies that's not actually the case! 
Here I am reviewing requirements and responsibilities for ""Data Scientist"" roles in some of the FAANG companies, choosing those as a proxy for big tech companies with a lot of data to play with. 
The reality is that what you will actually do at your job depends more on the size and data maturity of the company than the name of your role. 
As a rule of thumb, unless ML IS THE PRODUCT, in smaller companies ""Data Scientists"" will do all things data, often falling into Data Engineering, Analytics, and Product/Project management. 
The bigger the company - the more roles are diversified, there you can find specialized ML Engineer, AI Researcher, and similar roles. 
Yet, many companies still want to hire people who know advanced Statistics and ML as Data Scientists, even if they haven't reached the relevant level in the data hierarchy of needs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

If you want to make sure you will apply your ML knowledge at your job on a regular basis, not just when you find a rare opportunity that fits business needs, look into Machine Learning Engineer/ Software Engineer / AI Researcher roles like those: (relevant as of August 2021)

Data Scientist roles for comparison require advanced statistics knowledge, but not necessarily applied knowledge of Machine Learning and AI:

There are some companies that break the rule, like Amazon, here they say a DS will be ""Improving upon existing machine learning methodologies by developing new data sources, developing and testing model enhancements...""

In this video I go through the planning and idea creation for this new data science project. 

I have gotten quite a few requests to do data science project from scratch. I also left these series mostly unedited so you can see me get stuck and how I figure out the path forward. 

The next phases of the project are, data collection, data cleaning, eda, model building, and productionzation. 

For data science project ideation, you generally have two approaches. You can look through available data on kaggle or google data, or you can come up with an idea and then go out and find your data. In this video, I show you how to do both approaches.

I end up choosing a data science project based on a simple whiteboarding session. We will try to predict data science salaries based on data scraped from glassdoor or linkedin. 

In part 2 I will show you how to scrape your data and how to set up a github repo.

Ситуации, когда алгоритмы эффективно заменяют людей и меняют целые отрасли рассмотрены на примерах как сервисов Яндекса, так и некоторых других крупнейших мировых компаний. При этом наряду с повышением эффективности и другими достижениями возникают и неприятные побочные эффекты, способные в итоге повлиять на веками складывавшиеся в человеческом обществе институты – об этом тоже важно знать."

Vous avez tous entendu parler de Data Sciences mais vous vous demandez encore ce que cela peut bien être et ce qui se cache derrière ce concept. C’est vrai qu’avec la foison d’informations qui sont diffusées par les médias ou disponibles sur internet on a un peu de mal à faire la part des choses concernant cette approche multidisciplinaire émergente. On trouve un peu tout et n’importe quoi sur ce domaine. Pas de panique, je vais essayer de vous aider à y voir plus clair et tenter de vous expliquer tout cela de la façon la concise et la plus simple qui soit. 

Les Data Sciences, ou sciences des données en Français, regroupent en fait un ensemble de disciplines dont la vocation est de produire des connaissances à partir d’informations de nature et de source diverses que l'on appelle données - d'où le mot data présent dans data sciences."

First, you'll stop working locally and you'll mostly be working in a cloud environment. Local development is ok for studying but that's not enough for production work. You need to get a clear understanding of cloud tools and services from either AWS, Google Cloud or Azure.

Next, you'll work with larger datasets. When studying or experimenting you might use some Kaggle datasets. But in the real world you'll work with millions of records. As Pandas is not efficient for large datasets you'll need to work with tools that allow for distributed computing. One tool like that is Apache Spark and you need to master it.

Last one is that you'll spend most of your time ingesting and preprocessing data. When you're studying you might focus on machine learning, algorithms and hyperparameter tuning. But in the real world that's only going to take only 10% of your time if that. Most of your time will be spent on data engineering tasks rather than data scientist ones.

Data Science requires continuous learning, on the job and outside of the job. Keep yourself ready for new developments and embrace them.

Data Science Full Course Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3us_ELKYSj_Fth2tIEkdKXvV

Step by step approach on learning data science is,

1) Pick a data science project first: you can use kaggle.com datasets or competitions for this. 

2) Learn either python or R programming language. For python you can follow this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eykoKxsYtow&list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S

3) Once you have basic understanding of python, you need to learn data exploration and data cleaning using pandas. Here is the playlist for pandas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmorAWRsCAw&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuASpe-1LjfG5f14Bnozjwy

4) Jupyter notebook is an essential tool that you can use as a code editor. Here is the tutorial on notebook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZX_0FMEc

5) matplotlib is widely used for data visualization and for that also I've a playlist of tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqwf4Vuj8oM&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu4Lr8_kro2AqaO6CFYgKOl

6) Once data cleaning and exploration is over, next step is to build machine learning model. For statistical models we can use sklearn library and for deep learning we can use pytorch and google's tensorflow. For machine learning I've created very easy to follow tutorial list: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmvvaobm7eQ&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw

I'm in dire need of more accountability so really looking forward to firmly establishing a morning learning habit AND I can't wait to chat with you guys during the breaks ❤️

Please note that THIS IS NOT A TAUGHT LESSON. We're just hanging out and motivating each other to be productive c:

Rules:
No discrimination, abuse, self promotion, financial advice, politically controversial comments, or spam allowed. We've also had instances where people were breaking the rules in a language that some mods and I can't read so we could not take action in a timely manner. Because of this, I am also banning extended conversation in any non-english languages. Feel free to have 1 - 2 exchanges though! If you want to have a longer conversation, please do so in the discord. These rules apply to everybody in the stream. 

Note: I'm not one to try to restrict people's freedom of speech so the tolerance that mods and I have is quite high. You can make comments and talk about anything else. However, if you break these rules once, we will delete your messages, time you out, and give you a warning. If you do it again we will permanently ban you indiscriminately. The goal of these streams is to create a safe, productive, and hopefully entertaining study environment where we keep each other accountable as we work towards our goals. 

Examples of things that are okay to say: 
""Why you look so tired"" (I get this every single stream maybe I should actually have a FAQ too lol)
""You suck at data science"" (This is not very constructive but it is an opinion and doesn't violate the rules)
""Data science is gonna be taken over by robots and we're all gonna lose our jobs"" (I don't agree with this but it is an opinion and doesn't violate the rules)

Example of things that are NOT okay: 
""I hate [insert ethnic group]"" (or anything along these lines)
""[insert mod name] you're a piece of poop"" (or anything along these lines)
""pls review my resume"" x 10 (pls don't spam)

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Promoting ML projects from “proof of concept” to “ongoing project” status reveals how difficult it is to work on them as a team. Researchers and engineers try various model types, feature engineering, and data sources in parallel. Recording, reviewing, and integrating what everyone did is difficult and error-prone. The problems become worse as team size increases and teams become distributed.

Data Science (hay còn gọi là Khoa học dữ liệu) trở thành một trong những ngành có nhu cầu nhân lực cao nhất ở thế kỷ 21. Thuật ngữ “Data Science” cũng là thuật ngữ được nhiều người nhắc đến hằng ngày. Data Science được định nghĩa là tất cả những gì về thu thập, khai thác và phân tích dữ liệu để tìm ra insight giá trị. Sau đó trực quan hóa các Insight cho các bên liên quan, để chuyển hóa Insight thành hành động. Đây là lĩnh vực đa ngành sử dụng các phương pháp và quy trình khoa học để rút ra insight từ dữ liệu.

Pandas là là thư viện mã nguồn mở với hiệu năng cao cho phân tích dữ liệu trong Python được phát triển bởi Wes McKinney  trong năm 2008. Chỉ với hơn 1 năm phát triển nó đã trở thành một thư viện chuẩn cho việc phân tích dữ liệu khi dùng Python. Pandas là một thư viện mã nguồn mở được xây dựng dựa trên NumPy, sử dụng thao tác và phân tích dữ liệu, được thiết kế để cho phép bạn làm việc với dữ liệu được gắn nhãn hoặc quan hệ theo cách trực quan hơn

- Có thể xử lý tập dữ liệu khác nhau về định dạng: chuỗi thời gian, bảng không đồng nhất, ma trận dữ liệu
- Khả năng import dữ liệu từ nhiều nguồn khác nhau như CSV, DB/SQL
- Có thể xử lý vô số phép toán cho tập dữ liệu: subsetting, slicing, filtering, merging, groupBy, re-ordering, and re-shaping,..
- Xử lý dữ liệu mất mát theo ý người dùng mong muốn: bỏ qua hoặc chuyển sang 0
- Xử lý, phân tích dữ liệu tốt như mô hình hoá và thống kê
- Tích hợp tốt với các thư viện khác của python
- Cung cấp hiệu suất tốt

To get you on board and start billing the client. 

Your career goals matter less to them than they matter to you. You have to own your career and respect your medium to long term plans. Because in a consultancy is very easy to get pushed into a role that may not be aligned with what you initially thought. 

Also the fact that data science is relatively ambiguous to many hiring managers doesn't really help. When the consultancy pitches for a project they won't have the clearest picture of the initial responsibilities of the role but they will push you into the role because they still get to bill the client.

Data science is fundamental to success—and leveraging it is imperative to being competitive in the market.

As we covered in the first conversation in this series with Adam and Dan, the way your organization uses data is important. If you aren’t actively managing, governing and operationalizing your data, you will inevitably fall behind.

So we know how important data is. We know we need to use it, and we know how important it is that we use it the right way. With this in mind, how do we take the next steps as we stand up your advanced analytics capabilities without overloading the analytics team and ensuring we're getting the right data we can use to learn the right things, solve problems better, and get ahead?

Are the challenges we face with our data analytics process really just problems with our backlogs? And if so, where do we go from there?

LeadingAgile’s Adam Jennison and Dan Smith have collectively spent decades in product management roles in multiple organizations for data-driven products. In this conversation, they address the answers these questions and more."

Have you heard about bias and variance? These concepts are very important to know yet a bit confusing to get a solid understanding of. I've had my fair share of being confused by bias and variance and the trade-off they have.

In this video we will talk about what bias and variance is, the consequences of high bias and high variance and some solutions to deal with each."

I'll let you in on a secret...we look at the rate cards from large consulting companies and price based on them. That's what our clients are used to so those are the rates we use to baseline our own.

However, that's not everything you need to set a rate. You need to put yourself at the right level and in the right rate structure. Otherwise you can be shortchanging yourself or setting a rate that no one is willing to pay you.

The justification you'll put on your rate card is based on classifying yourself based on factors I will walk you through in detail."

why python is used in machine learning and many more untold topics.

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Some machine learning methods
Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.

Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.
In contrast, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.
Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise, acquiringunlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.
Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.
Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster, more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and resources to train it properly. Combining machine learning with AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more effective in processing large volumes of information.
Data science is the study of where information comes from, what it represents and how it can be turned into a valuable resource in the creation of business and IT strategies. Mining large amounts of structured and unstructured data to identify patterns can help an organization rein in costs, increase efficiencies, recognize new market opportunities and increase the organization's competitive advantage.
The data science field employs mathematics, statistics and computer science disciplines, and incorporates techniques like machine learning, cluster analysis, data mining and visualization."

What is Power BI?
When looking for the answer to “What is Power BI?”, we need to look no further than the tool’s creator, Microsoft. The company defines Power BI as “…a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.” The BI stands for “business intelligence,” and the tool gives non-technical users all the resources they need to aggregate, visualize, analyze, and share data. The business world considers Power BI one of the best drag-and-drop tools available in the industry today.

What is Tableau?
Tableau is a leading data visualization tool used for data analysis and business intelligence. Gartner’s Magic Quadrant classified Tableau as a leader for analytics and business intelligence. This Tableau tutorial will cover a wide range of how-to topics, including how to create different charts and graphs, in addition to visualizing data through reports and dashboards in Tableau to derive meaningful insights.

What is Excel?
Excel is a powerful spreadsheet application created by Microsoft which helps you to understand and analyze business functions. This application is mainly useful for business heads for taking decisions about their business.  Microsoft introduced a number of new features in Excel 2013, such as saving files in remote locations, new chart types, slicers and timeline feature to work with pivot tables, FlashFill, etc. All these features allow the user to work with data more efficiently and effectively.

Подробная информация о курсе, программа обучения по ссылке - https://pymagic.ru 

В этом видео привела основные вопросы на собеседованиях на позицию Data Scientist, так как часто в начале задают вопросы по определениям, и уже после ответа, переходят у уточнениям: основной смысл, отличия, где используется и т.д. 

Стоит учитывать, что рассмотренные темы отлично применимы, если вы только начинаете свою карьеру в Data Science, либо уже имеете средний уровень. Рассмотренные вопросы касаются классического ML. Например, если вы занимаетесь Object Detection, то сверху у вас еще будут задания по соответствующей тематике. 

Ну и конечно на позицию Senior и Lead вы просто ОБЯЗАНЫ знать весь этот материал без каких-либо НО-ЕСЛИ-НЕ ПОМНЮ =) Их тоже спросят =)

In recent times, cybersecurity has undergone massive shifts in technology as well as its operations in the context of computing. Analysis suggests the concept of data science is driving this change. The quest to develop comprehensive solutions with a partial paradigm shift from traditional well-known security solutions such as firewalls, user authentication, and access control, cryptography systems etc. which do not wholly address today’s cybersecurity needs have become paramount. 

The ultimate goal of cybersecurity data science is data-driven intelligent decision-making from security data for smart cybersecurity solutions. Hence this webinar session.

We hope that through this session, participants would be able to:
- explain the common terminologies related to Cybersecurity Data Science
- understand the concept of Cybersecurity Data Science and the Cybersecurity Classical Methods
- understand Machine Learning techniques used in Cybersecurity Data Science
- know what the future of Cybersecurity Data science is and its challenges."

About the course 

Python has been one of the premier, flexible, and powerful open-source language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and has powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis. For over a decade, Python has been used in scientific computing and highly quantitative domains such as finance, oil and gas, physics, and signal processing. 

Edureka's Python Certification Training not only focuses on the fundamentals of Python, Statistics and Machine Learning but also helps one gain expertise in applied Data Science at scale using Python. The training is a step by step guide to Python and Data Science with extensive hands-on. The course is packed with several activity problems and assignments and scenarios that help you gain practical experience in addressing predictive modeling problems that would either require Machine Learning using Python. Starting from basics of Statistics such as mean, median and mode to exploring features such as Data Analysis, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Naive Bayes, Cross-Validation, Label Encoding, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines with a supporting example and exercise help you get into the weeds. 

Furthermore, you will be taught of Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence. You will be able to train your machine based on real-life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Edureka’s Python course will also cover both basic and advanced concepts of Python like writing Python scripts, sequence and file operations in Python. You will use libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit, and master concepts like Python machine learning, scripts, and sequence.

Why learn Python?

It's continued to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.

E quem comanda o vídeo de hoje é Dani Evangelista, nossa educadora da trilha de Node.js, e ela veio para responder as dúvidas da comunidade sobre esse universo.

Vamos falar sobre Node v17.0.0 e quais as novidades acompanham essa nova versão do Node.js. Será que as outras ORMs ficam atrás do Prisma? Consigo criar meu próprio banco de dados?

Qual a melhor maneira de estudar arquitetura de software? Dani dá algumas dicas de referências e conta o que ela mesma usa nos seus estudos. Sugestões de como detectar e corrigir erros com mais facilidade.

Essa nova temporada do PR está completamente diferente, dessa vez queremos tirar dúvidas na prática e gerar uma conversa produtiva sobre assuntos que circulam no universo da programação.

Начать заниматься data science в сентябре 2017, а к февралю 2018 стать экспертом науки о данных и получать офферы на Chief Data Scientist. Думал, такое не возможно, пока не познакомился с Пашей Плесковым из Data Nerds. Внимание: Видео может вызвать FOMO и отвесить пинка под зад. Скоро снова сентябрь =) Хотите повторить? Смотрите, как.

The popular Data Science competition website Kaggle has an ongoing competition to solve the problem of earthquake prediction. Given a dataset of seismographic activity from a laboratory simulation, participants are asked to create a predictive model for earthquakes. In this video, I'll attempt the challenge as a way to teach 3 concepts; the Data Science mindset, Categorical Boosting, and Support Vector Regression models. I'll be coding this using python from start to finish in the online Google colab environment. Enjoy!

Both are great platforms, but which is best for you?

Kaggle and github are the two many ways that you can showcase your work as a data scientist or aspiring data scientist. You also constantly hear me blabbering about how valuable each of these platforms are. In this video, I will compare the two platforms to determine which is the best place for you to host your data science portfolio on. 

Kaggle is arguably the largest data science community out there. It started as a place where people could go to compete against each other in data science competitions. It still has these competitions, but now it has evolved into a one stop shop for data science learning, awesome datasets, and engaged forum. On Kaggle, you have a profile where you can earn rankings for sharing your work and placing well in competitions. 

Github, on the other hand, is more focused on function. Github is one of the hosting platforms for the versioning control system called git. Git allows you and your team to keep track of the changes in your code. This can be extremely valuable when you have multiple people working on a project. Git has also evolved into a place where you keep and maintain all of the code that you write. Many developers use their github profile & repositories as a living documentation for all they have done. 

Kaggle:
+ Simple Reward System
+ Great Community 
+ Discoverability
+ Clear Focus on Data Science 
- Limited ways to share 
- limited in the skills you can showcase 

Github:
+Shows you know GIT
+ Highlights Documentation
+ Illustrates More Diverse Skillset 
+ More Flexibility
-More difficult to use
-Greater time commitment 
- Additional skills like git & markdown

This is Part 2 of my kaggle project from scratch series where I analyze the kaggle data science developer survey data. 

In this video I show you how I approach data cleaning, data manipulation, and some light Exploratory data analysis. This video is meant to focus more on my process than the actual coding or results. I also use plotly for this project which is a tool I was previously unfamiliar with. I show you how I learn by getting my hands dirty. 

Part 1: https://youtu.be/r-DR9HBaipU

From a technical perspective, I do the following:
- Outline my analysis 
- load in and briefly explore the data 
- Check for null values 
- Organize the data so that it can be easily used to create charts 
- Create some basic charts with plotly express and plotly go
- Organize the data so that it can be segmented by profession 
- Build one ""advanced visual"" showing you the 4 iterations that it took me to get there. 

Resources I used:
- https://plotly.com/python/histograms/
- https://plotly.com/python/heatmaps/
- https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59406167/plotly-how-to-filter-a-pandas-dataframe-using-a-dropdown-menu

Kaggle, on the other hand, is an amazing platform for those who wanted to learn Machine Learning by doing it. While we perform Machine Learning on the data provided by #Kaggle, sometimes it's hard to work with that data in our local system, so solve this problem you can make use of Google Colab. Using Google Colab, you will be able to run all your ML queries using the free RAM and Disk space provided by Google. The Disk space provided by Google is temporary, so it's always a good idea to keep the data into Google Drive and work on Colab using the data from the drive. 

#Kagglecompetition
This video explains the process of getting the data directly from the Kaggle website to your Google Drive account. Once you have the data into the google drive, you can make use of it for your project.

💡 What You’ll Learn
In Lesson 1 (Introduction), you’ll learn more about what the course covers.

Most machine learning libraries (including scikit-learn) give an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. In Lesson 2 (Missing Values), you’ll learn about three different approaches for dealing with missing values in your data.

A categorical variable is a variable that takes only a limited number of values, and it’s common to encounter them in data. Learn how to work with them in Lesson 3 (Categorical Variables).

HINTS:
1) In order to try to stay below the 5 submission cap, create your own validation set to test against before you submit your model's predictions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets

2) In order to improve the accuracy of your model, use machine learning to find patterns in the data that you may not have known about. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html

Kaggle is a great competitive platform for data science projects that also ropes in lots of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) work. There are lots of interested data analyses and other work you can find in the competitions. They have great datasets, interesting competitions, and nice rewards. Kaggle is a great way to hone your data science and ML skills, and I highly recommend it! Paired with other methods, I think Kaggle can be the best way to learn ML and the best way to learn data science, or at least one of the best (and it's free).

Join us for a new adventure on our journey to deep learning and data science in general 🎉 powered by Kaggle!

This brand new course is free, and you can now earn a certificate. Just bring your curiosity and get ready to meet our growing community 😀

Agenda:
- Introductions and get to know our community

- Deep Learning Adventures - Coding Presentation:
We will be following the course material and exercises at:
https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series

1 Linear Regression With Time Series
Use two features unique to time series: lags and time steps.

2 Trend
Model long-term changes with moving averages and the time dummy.

3 Seasonality
Create indicators and Fourier features to capture periodic change.

4 Time Series as Features
Predict the future from the past with a lag embedding.

5 Hybrid Models
Combine the strengths of two forecasters with this powerful technique.

6 Forecasting With Machine Learning
Apply ML to any forecasting task with these four strategies.

Bonus content:
Bonus 1: Facebook/Meta Prophet
Prophet is a forecasting procedure implemented in R and Python. It is fast and provides completely automated forecasts that can be tuned by hand by data scientists and analysts.
URL: https://facebook.github.io/prophet

Bonus 2: ROCKET
ROCKET [1] transforms time series using random convolutional kernels (random length, weights, bias, dilation, and padding). ROCKET computes two features from the resulting feature maps: the max, and the proportion of positive values (or ppv). The transformed features are used to train a linear classifier.
[1] Dempster A, Petitjean F, Webb GI (2019) ROCKET: Exceptionally fast and accurate time series classification using random convolutional kernels. arXiv:1910.13051

MINIROCKET: A Very Fast (Almost) Deterministic Transform for Time Series Classification arXiv:2012.08791
https://github.com/angus924/minirocket

Bonus 3: The M5 Forecasting Competition
The aim of the M5 Competition is similar to the previous four: that is to identify the most appropriate method(s) for different types of situations requiring predictions and making uncertainty estimates. Its ultimate purpose is to advance the theory of forecasting and improve its utilization by businesses and non-profit organizations. Its other goal is to compare the accuracy/uncertainty of ML and DL methods vis-à-vis those of standard statistical ones, and assess possible improvements versus the extra complexity and higher costs of using the various methods.

HANDLE LARGE IMAGE DATASETS LIKE A DATA SCIENTIST

In this kaggle tutorial you'll be learning how to handle large image datasets in kaggle like a data scientist! We'll be using jupyter notebooks, when you create your kaggle kernel you'll also going to be using a jupyter notebook. 

If you never heard of jupyter notebook you can checkout the site docs here
https://jupyter.org/
jupyter notebook are a great tool to make shareable and replicable code, a jupyter notebook was used on the LIGO research, how cool is that? They grew in popularity as well as anaconda ( python library manager ) , one thing great about jupyter notebook is that you can publish your jupyter notebook on github and your jupyter notebook will be rendered in the page, pretty cool :D 

But let's go to the facts. Handling large image datasets in kaggle competitions can be a pain sometimes, even if you follow a kaggle tutorial ( usually a jupyter notebook btw ).

But don't you worry! This is the time where we get our hands on working with this nasty little things in those awesome kaggle competitions!

If you don't know kaggle at all, you can check out their website here
https://www.kaggle.com/
It's a great place to get started, you can use the kaggle kernels and kaggle tutorials as guide 
You can check out the kernels ( kaggle tutorial ) here
https://www.kaggle.com/kernels
If you want to create your own Kernel you'll problably want to get familiar with jupyter notebook :D. 

You could also go to a competition that you've liked and search for a specific kaggle tutorial on them
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions
kaggle also has a discussion part, you can find some kaggle tutorial in this section as well
https://www.kaggle.com/discussion

In this kaggle discussion section you can find kaggle tutorial like this one 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/crowdflower-weather-twitter/discussion/6046

You can also participate into discussions to get medals, this will get you ranked on the kaggle website. You can get ranked by posting new kernels ( like a kaggle tutorial ), or you could help some one on the discussion forum. Or you could participate into competions. 
Kaggle has 5 levels in all of the above, kaggle competition, kaggle discussion and kaggle kernel ( kaggle tutorial )

#1 Novice
#2 Contributor 
#3 Expert
#4 Master
#5 Grandmaster 

Also, when you create your own kaggle tutorial and see the feedback of the community this will help you grow as a data scientist into the community, you can check out the new state of the art models that are used in this kaggle tutorials.

From Kaggle Email:

In Lesson 1 (How Models Work), you will start at the very beginning: what exactly is “machine learning”, and how is it used in the real world? You’ll learn the answers to these questions and explore the basics of decision trees, as you start to build a strong foundation for some of the most cutting-edge techniques in data science.

In Lesson 2 (Basic Data Exploration), you’ll learn all about pandas, the primary tool used by data scientists for exploring and manipulating data. Then, you’ll use your new knowledge to examine a dataset of home prices.

On this channel, over the next two months we will be completing this competition and attempting to provide an accurate methodology for predicting realized volatility over a 10-minute trading window.

In this first video, first we look at some advice from Robbert Pullen (an Optiver Trainer) with regards to financial markets and marker making. The complete video link is provided below the video timeline, this was created by @Optiver Europe. 

We will then consider how we can place option prices in the marketplace into perspective, are they high or are they low? One visual method of considering our option price marketplace is to create a graph of a Historical Volatility Cone and compare this to Implied Volatility in financial markets (offered by Market Makers). I have used the same methodology as provided by a link in StackExchange (link below), and have replicated this for the ASX200 index.

""How to win competitions, spending a minimum amount of time""

Kaggle Days Paris was held in January 2019 and gathered over 200 participants to meet, learn and code with Kaggle Grandmasters, and compete in our traditional offline competition. 

This edition is presented by LogicAI in partnership with Kaggle and sponsored by LVMH, Christian Dior, Sephora, and Louis Vuitton. 

Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers created by LogicAI and Kaggle.

About Pavel:
“I am a deep learning engineer at Samsung AI Center Moscow. Also, I’m studying at the Higher School of Economics at the faculty of Computer Science. Previously, I worked on Yandex (Russian search engine) for 1,5 years as a developer of a distributed system for keeping and processing a large amount of data. I love traveling, fishing and challenges in deep learning. I think Kaggle gives us an opportunity to learn things very fast and test our knowledge on practice having a ready task, so, I can’t stop spending all of my free time on competitions.”

About LogicAI:
LogicAI as a creator of Kaggle Days is a sole partner of Kaggle to build global offline community. 
LogicAI is a boutique Data Science consultancy company owned by Kaggle fans and Grandmasters. As a global company, they do custom end-to-end AI and Data Science development projects as well as trainings for C-level management and tech teams.

This video is part two of a two-part series.

Kaggle is a subsidiary of Google and an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. On Kaggle, you can find many published datasets, data science and machine learning tutorials but most importantly, Kaggle is best known for their competitions.

The Titanic survival prediction competition is a great beginner's competition that introduces beginners to not only the Kaggle platform but also the process behind an end-to-end machine learning project, from loading and reading datasets to building a fully functional predictive model.

The aim of this competition is to analyse how different passenger features such as age, gender and ticket class correlate with survival and subsequently train a machine learning model to classify unknown passenger data. This is an example of a binary classification problem in machine learning where passengers are classified as either survived or did not survive.

This video covers the data preprocessing and modelling sections of my notebook. Data preprocessing is the process behind getting our datasets ready for model training which includes fill and missing values, data transformation, feature engineering and label encoding.

Once our datasets are ready, we can then move on to building a machine learning model. Depending on the type of problem that we are trying to solve using machine learning, we should choose models that are most suitable. Sci-kit learn is one of the most popular libraries in Python for machine learning and this is what I have used for the modelling component of the Titanic survival prediction competition. 

In the end, I have chosen the support vector classifier as my model of choice and successfully achieved a submission score of 77.5%.

A lot of time has gone into preparing the solution notebook as well as this video. So, if you enjoyed it or found it helpful in your own learning, it would mean the world to mean if you could like the video and subscribe to my channel.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. Happy learning!

https://amzn.to/3nUD6Jq

データの前処理、特徴量作成、モデリング、評価などを学ぶのに非常にオススメな書籍なんです。

Kaggleというのは世界的に有名なデータ分析コンペで世界中のデータ分析の猛者が日々しのぎをけずっています。

コンペとはいっても参加するのには複雑な手続きなどはいらず誰でも簡単に参加できるので、初心者の方がデータ分析のスキルを身に着けていくのにうってつけの場です。

そんなKaggleには称号というものがあり、コンペで優秀な成績をおさめると一定の基準でグランドマスターやマスターなどの称号が与えられます。

それらの称号を得ている人たちが共著で執筆したのが、この「Kaggleで勝つデータ分析の技術」なんです。

ただ注意しておいて欲しいのがこの書籍はあくまでKaggleコンペでのデータ分析に特化しているということ。

コンペではある程度整形されたデータが提供され、分析課題も決まっています。

実務のデータ分析では、そもそも課題の洗い出しからデータ分析に値する課題設定と目的の明確化、そしてデータ取得、現場への導入など前処理・モデリング・モデル評価以外の工程もたくさんあるんです。

そこをしっかり理解した上で読みましょう！

この書籍の章立ては以下のようになっています。
第1章：分析コンペとは
第2章：タスクと評価指標
第3章：特徴量の作成
第4章：モデルの作成
第5章：モデルの評価
第6章：モデルのチューニング
第7章：アンサンブル

Step 1: Sign in to google and open Google Colab notebook
Step 2: Install dependencies by executing the following command
            !pip install kaggle
Step 3: Go to your kaggle account and sign in
           ---go to my account option
           ---Now scroll down and there will be an option named ""create new API token""
           ---click on that option and a kaggle.json file will be downloaded
Step 4: Now we have to upload that kaggle.json file in Google colab. We need to run the
            following command:

            from google.colab import files
            files.upload()

  A choose option will appear. Choose the kaggle.json file

Step 5: Now change the directory 
           !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
           !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/

and also change the permission
           !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

Step 6: Now we will import data set. So go to kaggle.com. Sign in and choose any dataset you like. Now accept terms and conditions if there any and copy download API command.


Step 7: Now go back to google colab and paste the command and add ""!"" exclamation mark as a prefix and run it. Wait for a moment and the data set will be downloaded in a zip file.

Step 8: Since the dataset is in zip file, we need to extract it. To do that first we need zip file pacakages.
          !pip install zip_files

Step 9: Now extract the file by using the following code
           from zipfile import ZipFile
           file_name=""your_file_name.zip""
           with ipfile(file_name,'r') as zip:
                  zip.extractall()
                  print('Done')
That's it. Your file will be extracted."

The aim of this episode is to get you up to speed as fast as possible so that you can participate. This challenge is hosted by Francois Chollet, the creator of the popular deep learning library Keras, and there are still 3 months to go. The goal is to create an algorithm that can learn the relationship between input-output pairs of colored tiles. Sounds simple at first, but upon closer inspection, creating an algorithm that's able to do so given such a small dataset requires genuine AI innovation. Deep Learning won't work because it requires big datasets and expensive compute, so even though this challenge is difficult, it's also the most accessible! We'll be learning about the dataset, related paper, and the various techniques that Kagglers have already attempted. Then, we'll learn about Neural Program Synthesis and future directions that could ultimately solve this problem. Enjoy!

From Kaggle Email:

In Lesson 6 (Strings and Dictionaries), you’ll learn about strings, which is a data type that is useful for representing human-readable data, such as text. A dictionary is another new data type, that is similar to a list, but with important differences that makes it incredibly useful in its own right.

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews the CEO of Kaggle: Anthony Goldbloom. 

Anthony has a background in economics and has been working on Kaggle, working on the other side of Kaggle as the CEO and co founder for almost over a decade now, 

They talk about his journey as the co founder of Kaggle,  and even Kaggle's journey broadly speaking over the few past few years. How Kaggle has evolved, how their perspective, how their team's perspective on Kaggle and the team itself has evolved from the start until the point even after it got acquired by Google. 

This interview shares a lot of insights about the behind the scenes work that goes into Kaggle while hosting a competition, broadly speaking, or even putting out a new course on Kaggle learn.

They also discuss Kaggle's future plans and what's next and exciting for us as frequent Kagglers.

Ever wondered how to become ranked #1 on Kaggle? StackNet has helped me do that! StackNet is an open-source, scalable and automated meta-modelling framework that combines various supervised models to improve performance. Written in Java, this library automates many of the laborious aspects of building stacking models, so that you can focus on the important parts and move higher up the Kaggle leaderbo   ards.

Data management is a key component of optimizing a TPU performance. In this video, Kaggle Educator Ryan Holbrook walks us through using creating TFRecords, which are binary files that contain sequences of byte-strings. Data needs to be serialized (encoded as a byte-string) before being written into a TFRecord.

It's not a competition but a challenge to make a habit of coding ML every day. If you haven't registered for the Kaggle Challenge Don't worry, You can follow along my videos every day.

From Kaggle Email:

In Lesson 3 (Booleans and Conditionals), you’ll learn all about the Boolean data type, which allows you to represent “True” and “False” in Python code. This will provide a strong foundation for understanding how to write conditional statements, which are used to modify how code runs based on whether certain conditions hold.

This is the fourth part of Problem Solving. An Exciting chapter which covers:
1. Feature Selection
2. Outliers Treatment
3. Handling non-normally distributed continuous features.
4. Features Standardization.
5. SMOTE


Understanding why and when employees are most likely to leave can lead to actions to improve employee retention as well as possibly planning new hiring in advance. I will be using a step-by-step systematic approach using a method that could be used for a variety of ML problems. This project would fall under what is commonly known as ""HR Analytics"", ""People Analytics"".  

- What is the likelihood of an active employee leaving the company?
- What are the key indicators of an employee leaving the company?
- What policies or strategies can be adopted based on the results to improve employee retention?


This problem consists of 4 parts.

Part 1: About Employee Attrition Prediction and CRISP-DM Introduction
Part 2: Hands-on Python Implementation. Data Collection, EDA, Preprocessing and Visualization, Data Understanding.
Part 3: Outlier detection, Baseline Implementation of Machine Learning Models, Accuracy vs Precision vs Recall vs F1 Score, SMOTE.
Part 4: Feature Selection, Features Standardization, Outlier treatment and taking care of non-normally distributed continuous features.

I used the HR employee attrition data set that comes from the [IBM Watson website](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/) to test out several advanced ML techniques. The dataset includes 1470 employees (rows) and 35 features (columns) a portion of which have left the organization (Attrition = “Yes”). Note that according to IBM, “this is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists”.

They enrolled in the NYC Data Science Academy 12-Week Full Time Bootcamp taking place between July - September 2016. This is their fifth project - Capstone Project, which was due in the 12th week of the program.

Ranking #1 on Kaggle for Predicting Consumer Debt Default

The team participated in a Kaggle closed competition to predict consumer credit default. Banks continue to look for the best credit scoring algorithm and one of its tenets is to predict the probability of an individual defaulting on their loan or undergoing financial distress. With this information, banks can make better decisions and borrowers can also do better financial planning. This challenge allowed the team to employ the best of machine learning models and algorithms to accurately predict the probability of default. Besides the technical aspects of the project, the team also used an Agile process designed for machine learning to ensure tasks can be done in parallel, in small chunks, and to fail fast, and iterate fast. The team ultimately achieved the highest AUC score possible, through six highly tuned models. They not only reach the top tiers of the scoreboard, but also smashed through to garner the #1 top ranking in the challenge. This is the story of how they did it.

Despite their increasing popularity, the research community cannot yet count on a large, curated dataset of computational notebooks. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing KGTorrent, a dataset of Python Jupyter notebooks with rich metadata retrieved from Kaggle, a platform hosting data science competitions for learners and practitioners with any levels of expertise. We describe how we built KGTorrent, and provide instructions on how to use it and refresh the collection to keep it up to date. Our vision is that the research community will use KGTorrent to study how data scientists, especially practitioners, use Jupyter Notebook in the wild and identify potential shortcomings to inform the design of its future extensions.

1583,Devs Guide,Solving Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster with Python,2017-12-28,UCBZYXOI-I_acCKk6bNJDaJg,4692,64,https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/B3cI_Ls_3Gk/maxresdefault.webp,1280,720,Science & Technology,kaggle|machine learning|data science|python|software engineering|titanic|historical data,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBZYXOI-I_acCKk6bNJDaJg,"The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

What's a better way to understand machine learning than a practical example? In this session, Ju Liu implements various machine learning tecniques step-by-step to predict the chance of survival of Titanic passengers, backed by real historical data and some amazing Python libraries.

Today’s Assignment
1. Read this tutorial (from Lesson 6 of the Python course)
https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/strings-and-dictionaries

2. Complete this exercise (from Lesson 6 of the Python course)

💡 What You’ll Learn
In Lesson 6 (Strings and Dictionaries), you’ll learn about strings, which is a data type that is useful for representing human-readable data, such as text. A dictionary is another new data type, that is similar to a list, but with important differences that makes it incredibly useful in its own right.

There is no way for one video to go over all of those reasons. In today's video, I will show you how to install and use the Kaggle API, allowing you access to the information that the Kaggle API can provide you. For instance, the ability to download datasets from their vast database. Welcome to the Islander community, where we are using python to learn machine learning applications through demonstration. 


#machinelearning
#kaggle
#pythonAPI
______________________________________________________________________
The steeps for today's video
Go to kaggle.com
Click on your profile
Once on your profile page, click on the account tab
Scrow down to the API section and click on create a new API token
Then open a terminal and make sure you are in the root directory
For windows,  mac, and Linux, you will want to type cd
Now create a .kaggle directory in the root directory 
mkdir .kaggle
Next, you will have to move the kaggle.json file from your downloads directory to the .kggle directory we just made.
Mv ~/Downloads/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle
The last step is to install the API, which you can do in 1 of three ways. I am also assuming that you have pip installed on your system
If you are not using a virtual machine, you can just run pip install Kaggle into your terminal
If you are using a virtual machine, you will want to activate that then enter pip install Kaggle into your terminal
Some IDEL allows you the ability to install python packages through them. This can be the easiest and fastest way to install the API
The Kaggle API is a command-line tool, so to test the install, you will want to run an API key like the one down bellow
kaggle datasets download -d camnugent/california-housing-prices
If you were able to download a zip file, then you have successfully installed and operated the Kaggle API

In this video, I talk about the motivation for this channel and then show how you can create a re-usable machine learning framework for simple tabular datasets.

Due to the size of the video, I split them into 2 sub-episodes:

Episode 1.1 consists of motivation, setting up a web based IDE, creating an empty framework and creating model training

Episode 1.2 shows how the trained model can be used for inference.

The whole idea behind this episode is to create code which is re-usable, looks good and can be applied to many different kinds of problem without changing a lot of code.

Please let me know in comments what you want to learn and I will make it happen :)

Dr Catriona Wallace is a well-known AI ethicist, who was the first female to launch an AI company on the ASX and she is strongly of the view that AI is an existential threat to humanity and will present arguments for that case.

Jeremy Howard is a serial entrepreneur who created FastMail, Kaggle and more recently Fast AI which has millions of users around the world, and he will be arguing that AI is not an existential threat.


Steve Nouri will moderate the session and pose questions to both."

Семинар ""Как проводить эксперименты в науках о данных?""
2 декабря 2021 г.



Науки о данных и технологии машинного обучения представляют ключевое направление развития современных образовательных программ. С одной стороны, навыки работы с данными помогают серьезно усилить эффективность прикладных проектов, и являются привлекательным направлением с точки зрения карьерного роста. С другой стороны, без серьезной практической составляющей изучение работы методов основанных на данных не дает возможность погрузиться в тонкости и понимание ограничений таких подходов.

Лаборатория НИУ ВШЭ Lambda тесно сотрудничает с несколькими международными исследовательскими коллаборациями, такими как LHCb, SHiP, OPERA, MPD@NICA. В своем докладе я расскажу о принципах и методологии, которой руководствуются сотрудники лаборатории, объединяя учебные и исследовательские задачи в рамках практических проектов. Немаловажным фактором является использование современных инструментов поддержки совместной работы, которые позволяют в игровой форме провести студентов через цепочку ключевых шагов исследования, понять принципы оценки границ применимости методов машинного обучения и оценить вклад каждого участника проекта."

December 1st, 2021

Abstract:
While speech and music processing have traditionally gained attention from the research community, the automatic recognition of sound events has received interest only in recent years, motivated by emerging applications in fields such as healthcare, smart homes, or urban planning. Prior to this thesis, research on sound event classification was mainly focused on supervised learning using small datasets, often carefully annotated with small vocabularies constrained to specific domains e.g., urban or domestic. However, ideal general-purpose sound event classifiers aim to recognize hundreds of sound events occurring in our everyday environment, such as kettle whistle, bird  tweet, fire alarm or car passing by. At the same time, large amounts of rich environmental sound data are hosted in web repositories such as Freesound or Youtube, which can be convenient for training data-hungry deep learning approaches. To advance the state-of-the-art in sound event classification, this thesis investigates several strands of dataset creation as well as supervised and unsupervised learning in order to train large-vocabulary sound event classifiers, using different types of supervision in novel and alternative ways.
The first part of this thesis focuses on the creation of FSD50K, a large-vocabulary dataset with over 100h of audio manually labeled using 200 classes of sound events. We provide a detailed description of the creation process and a comprehensive characterization of the dataset, including a set of classification experiments to provide insight on the data for machine listening tasks. In addition, we explore novel architectural modifications to increase shift invariance in CNNs, improving robustness to time/frequency shifts in input spectrograms and achieving stateof-the-art classification performance.

In the second part, we focus on training sound event classifiers using noisy labels, which can reduce the reliance on costly manual annotation processes. First, we propose a dataset that supports the investigation of real label noise, including an empirical characterization of the noise. Then, we explore and develop efficient network-agnostic approaches to mitigate the effect of label noise during training, including regularization techniques, noise-robust loss functions, and strategies to reject potential noisy labeled examples. Further, we develop a teacher-student framework to address the problem of missing labels in large sound event datasets using AudioSet as a use case.
In the third part, we propose multiple strategies to learn audio representations from unlabeled data. We develop novel self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks, where representations are learned by comparing pairs of examples selected by some semantically-correlated notion of similarity. Pairs of positive examples are computed via compositions of data augmentation and automatic sound separation methods. We obtain an unsupervised audio representation that rivals state-of-the-art alternatives on the  established AudioSet classification benchmark. Finally, we report on the organization of two DCASE Challenge Tasks on audio tagging with noisy labels.
Overall, this thesis contributes to the advancement of open and reproducible sound event research and to the transition from traditional supervised learning using clean labels to other learning strategies less dependent on annotation effort."

Here is a case study on ""Heart Disease Prediction Using R"". I have used logistic regression for analyzing the dataset using R Studio .  Logistic regression is yet another technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics. It's a powerful statistical way of modeling a binomial outcome with one or more explanatory variables. It measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative logistic distribution.

The purpose of this case study was to predict if a person has a heart disease or not based  on attributes blood pressure, heart beat, exang, fbs and others. The following task was performed for the execution of this case study:

1) Import the dataset and perform EDA.

2) Calculate the baseline model.

3) Split the dataset into Train and Test set. Remove the least  least significant variables and predict which patient have heart disease using logistic regression.

4) Plot the ROCR curve and find the accuracy of the predicted model.

안녕하세요
간단하게 AI와 관련된 과학 지식을 알려주는 한국딥러닝입니다!

여러분은 현봉식 배우와 이제훈 배우가 동갑이라는 사실을 알고있었나요?
성별과 나이를 예측하는 인공지능은
과연 이 두사람의 나이를 맞출 수 있을까요?

오늘은 AI를 활용해 이미지, 영상 등에서 얼굴을 인식하고,
나이와 성별을 예측하는 실습을 해볼거에요.

자세한 내용은 한국딥러닝 블로그에 있습니다.

In other words, PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle exponentially and makes you more productive.

PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with few lines only.This Python package supports following Machine Learning (ML) models and frameworks:
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
- spaCy
- Optuna
- Hyperopt
- Ray, and few more.

In this Demo I showed how to:
- Install PyCaret.
- Setup PyCaret environment in Jupyter Notebook
- Prepare data for analysis.
- Compare different ML models for the given dataset
- Analyze ML performance metrics
- Select the best ML model
- Check the model predictions
- Save the best model locally on your computer.

Links:
- Official PyCaret documentation: https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret
- Official PyCare Github repo: https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret

At the moment this video was recorded, there was PyCaret v.2.3 available. The project is updated very smartly and more interactive features will be available soon. Recommend to try it!"
