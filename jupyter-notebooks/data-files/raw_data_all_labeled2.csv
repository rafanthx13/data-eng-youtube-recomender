11:00 AM - 11:45 AM

In this talk I will show how complex visual inference tasks can be performed with Deep-Learning, in a totally unsupervised way, by training on a single image -- the test image itself. The strong recurrence of information inside a single natural image provides powerful internal examples which suffice for self-supervision of Deep-Networks, without any prior examples or training data. This new paradigm gives rise to true “Zero-Shot Learning”. I will show the power of this approach to a variety of problems, including super-resolution, image-segmentation, transparent layer separation, image-dehazing, image-retargeting, and more. I will further show how self-supervision can be used for “Mind-Reading” from very little fMRI data.

We will learn how to prepare and process data for artificial neural networks, build and train artificial neural networks from scratch.

Keras is an Open Source Neural Network library written in Python that runs on top of Theano or Tensorflow. It is designed to be modular, fast, and easy to use. Keras doesn't handle low-level computation. Instead, it uses another library to do it, called the ""Backend. So Keras is a high-level API wrapper for the low-level API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

If you want to make a simple network model with a few lines, Keras can help you with that. Leading organizations like Google, Square, Netflix, Huawei, and Uber are currently using Keras. This tutorial will walk you through different topics such as What is Keras and how to use it, How to start with Tensorflow, Difference between TensorFlow 1.18 and Tensorflow2.0, and much more.

Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on histograms and this lecture we're going to learn how to create histograms with our. And the G-G plot 2 package. We're going to first start off with installing Gigia plot to will also install a dataset with related the Gilia plot to called a cheesy plot to movies dataset. And before we actually start coding anything I'm going to show you a great cheat sheet resource that our studio provides for you for work and of G-G plot 2. OK. I'm super excited to show you all this. So let's go ahead and jump to our studio. OK so here we are our studio. Let's go ahead and start off by installing the packages we need. You're going to need to install G-G plot 2. So the start off will just go to Head and in the console you can say installed packages in quotes. Go ahead and pass G-G plot 2. That should take a little while to dollar install so I'm going to go ahead and fast forward and jump to when it's done installing. Gonna go ahead jump now. OK so it's finished installing. Second thing we're going to need to do is go ahead and just copy and paste the slide and common to appear in the script in case you need to reference it. It's also in the notes. Second thing I want to say is installed up packages and I'm going to go ahead and say cheesy plot to movies and that's going to go ahead and install the data set that we're gonna be working with. Right. That one's done. Going to go ahead and copy and paste it as a comment appear in the scripts. You can go ahead and positivity references if you need it. OK so before we get started on actually coding out a histogram what I want to show you is jump to my browser or your favorite browser real quick and find a cheat sheet that's going to be super useful for working of cheesy plot too. I'm going to go ahead and jump to the browser now. OK so I'm here in my browser and I went ahead and google searched our studio. Geez you plot cheat sheet. So I'm zoomed in right now on the results. But if you just google our studio use you plot cheat sheet the first link here should be the Ju-Ju plot to cheat sheet developed by our studio. So not that our studio developed just a plot to but that they created this cheat sheet. Although Hadley Wickham does actually work for our studio. So keep that in mind. Anyway as we go ahead and jump to the cheat sheet we have a wonderful PTF cheat sheet to work with as far as the different varieties of plots we can make with cheesy plot too. And it gives you a couple of nice formulas to follow as far as creating your plots. We won't have enough time to go over every single one of these plot types but we will go over enough plot types where you can eventually just reference's cheat sheet or even the documentation or plot types that you're looking for and know immediately how to create them. OK so first thing we're going to do is a histogram. So if we look throughout this cheat sheet right here we can see that we have a histogram method. So if I go ahead and zoom in a bit Lotusphere center screen we have Jiya underscore histogram. So our data and �sthetics layers are going to be really similar almost every single time. We'll either have an X or an X and Y depending on what kind of plot we want to create. But then after that we're really going to have to decide on is what kind of geometry layer we want. And in this case you're probably reference's cheat. Or the documentation and find the geometry layer that you're looking for. And they have a nice little mini visualization here so you can reference like oh yes I want a histogram since I'm looking for some sort of frequency plot. OK. Let's go ahead and jump back to our studio again. Mix it down his cheat sheet and reference it and I'm going to go ahead jump back to our studio and let's start plotting our history. OK we made it back to our studio. First thing we're going to do is call in the libraries and when I need G.G. plot too. And then for the dataset I'm going to need a library to plot two movies. Again there's no quotes it's recalling a library here. Just keep that in mind first layer that we're going to create in our grammar of graphics philosophy is the data layer and then the aesthetics layer. So data and aesthetics is what we're going to look for right now. So we start off by saying G-G plot a"

However, existing solutions are subjective to the expertise of humans who manually define features and often miss many vulnerabilities (i.e., incurring high false-negative rate). 

This presentation showcases the design and implementation of deep learning-based vulnerability detection systems to relieve human experts from the tedious and subjective task of manually defining features as well as to produce more effective vulnerability detection systems. The vulnerabilities that are detected are buffer errors and resource management errors in software. 

An approach called code gadgets [1] is used, which represents software programs and then transforms them into vectors. A code gadget is the number of lines of code that are semantically related to each other. The approach then demonstrates the identification of vulnerabilities in different software products. The attendees will learn how deep-learning methods are more than just an improvement over the traditional vulnerability detection systems. They will understand the end-to-end implementation and be able to replicate it at their workplace.

DJL is designed to be easy to get started with and simple to use for Java developers.DJL provides a set of high-level APIs to train, test and run inferences.

Java developers can develop their own models or utilize pre-trained models developed by data scientists in Python from their Java code.

DJL provides a convenient abstraction layer for using the most popular AI/ML frameworks such as Apache MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

With DJL API, you are getting a uniform and consistent layer that can interact with all of these frameworks, allowing you to swap out the framework of your choice without any impact to the client code.

Deep Java Library (DJL) is an open-source library

Developers can build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models using Java and their favorite IDE

DJL simplifies the use of deep learning (DL) frameworks and currently supports Apache MXNet, PyTorch and TensorFlow

DJL can also be configured with different underlying engines (such as MXNet, PyTorch, or TensorFlow)

Use native Java concepts and abstract away complexity involved with Deep learning

The open-source nature of DJL should be mutually beneficial for the toolkit and its users

DJL is engine agnostic, which means developers can write code once and run it on any engine

Java developers should have an understanding of the ML lifecycle and common ML terms before attempting to use DJL but don't need to be an expert

To ensure the best performance, DJL also provides automatic CPU/GPU choice based on the hardware configuration.

DJL offers a repository of pre-trained models in our ModelZoo that simplifies implementation and streamlines model sharing across projects.

The library can be referenced from the following URL - https://github.com/awslabs/djl

Over many years, Google developed an AI framework called TensorFlow and a development tool called Colaboratory. Today TensorFlow is open-sourced and since 2017, Google made Colaboratory free for public use. Colaboratory is now known as Google Colab or simply Colab. Another attractive feature that Google offers to the developers is the use of GPU. Colab supports GPU and it is totally free. The reasons for making it free for the public could be to make its software a standard in academics for teaching machine learning and data science. It may also have a long term perspective of building a customer base for Google Cloud APIs which are sold per-use basis. Irrespective of the reasons, the introduction of Colab has eased the learning and development of machine learning applications.

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool, but it is also incredibly data-hungry. Given a new task, an RL agent has to learn a good policy entirely from scratch. This paper proposes a new framework that allows an agent to carry over knowledge from previous tasks into solving new tasks, even deriving zero-shot policies that perform well on completely new reward functions.

Abstract:
The combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning is a promising approach to tackle important sequential decision-making problems that are currently intractable. One obstacle to overcome is the amount of data needed by learning systems of this type. In this article, we propose to address this issue through a divide-and-conquer approach. We argue that complex decision problems can be naturally decomposed into multiple tasks that unfold in sequence or in parallel. By associating each task with a reward function, this problem decomposition can be seamlessly accommodated within the standard reinforcement-learning formalism. The specific way we do so is through a generalization of two fundamental operations in reinforcement learning: policy improvement and policy evaluation. The generalized version of these operations allow one to leverage the solution of some tasks to speed up the solution of others. If the reward function of a task can be well approximated as a linear combination of the reward functions of tasks previously solved, we can reduce a reinforcement-learning problem to a simpler linear regression. When this is not the case, the agent can still exploit the task solutions by using them to interact with and learn about the environment. Both strategies considerably reduce the amount of data needed to solve a reinforcement-learning problem.

Be sure to watch these videos through https://course.fast.ai to get access to the searchable transcript, interactive notebooks, setup guides, questionnaires, and so forth. We don't recommend watching the videos directly on YouTube.

In this first lesson, we learn about what deep learning is, and how it's connected to machine learning, and regular computer programming. We get our GPU-powered deep learning server set up, and use it to train models across vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. We do this all in Jupyter Notebooks, using transfer learning from pretrained models for the vision and NLP training.

We discuss the important topics of test and validation sets, and how to create and use them to avoid over-fitting. We learn about some key jargon used in deep learning.

We also discuss how AI projects can fail, and techniques for avoiding failure."

Training DL models at scale is particularly challenging: training a single model can take days or weeks, and DL engineers are often forced to spend much of their time doing DevOps or writing boilerplate code to handle routine tasks like data loading, distributed training, or fault tolerance.

In this talk, we introduce Determined, an open source platform that enables deep learning teams to train models more quickly, easily share GPU resources, and effectively collaborate. This talk will include an overview of the problems that Determined aims to solve, the high-level architecture of the system, and show how Determined and Spark can be used together effectively. We’ll also dive deep on some key technical features, such as:

Distributed training without changing your model code
Intelligent hyperparameter search
Flexible GPU scheduling, including automatic management of cloud GPU instances
Automatic fault tolerance and checkpoint management
Seamless integration into the Spark ecosystem, e.g., for performing ETL or model inference.

This presentation covers end-to-end development cycle; from training the model to using it in web application. Machine Learning problem formulation The current solutions to detect semantic types of tabular data mostly rely on dictionary/vocabulary, regular expressions and rule-based look up to identify the semantic types. 
However, these solutions are 
1. Not robust to dirty and complex data and 
2. Not generalized to diverse data types. We formulate this into a Machine Learning problem by training a multi-class classifier to automatically predict the semantic type for tabular data. Model Training on Azure Databricks We choose Azure Databricks to perform the featurization and model training using PySpark SQL and Machine Learning Library. 

To speed up the featurization process, we leverage the PySpark Functions (UDF) to register and distribute the featurization functions into UDFs. For the model training, we pick the Random Forests as the classification algorithms and optimize the model hyperparameters using PySpark MLLib. Model Deployment using Azure Machine Learning. Azure Machine Learning provided the reusable and scalable capabilities to manage the lifecycle of Machine Learning models. We developed the E2E deployment pipeline on Azure Machine Learning including model preparation, computing initialization, model registration, and web service deployment. 
Serving as Web Service on Azure Kubernetes Azure Kubernetes provide the fast response and autoscaling capabilities serving model as web service together with the security authorization. We customized the AKS cluster with PySpark runtime to support PySpark based featurization and model scoring. Our model and scoring service are being deployed onto AKS cluster and served as HTTPS endpoints with both key-based and token-based authentication.

Over recent years, organizations across industries have either digitized or were founded as digital-native organizations, given them the competitive advantage to make data-driven decisions. As COVID-19 introduced new IT and security challenges, organizations further accelerated their digital transformations, along with their adoption of multi-cloud and hybrid models. Machine learning is the central component to succeeding within these data strategies. 

In this discussion, Dan will talk with Splunk CTO and SVP Tim Tully and Splunk Head of Machine Learning Ram Sriharsha about the criticality of machine learning within today’s digitized and cloud-first world. Both to improve resilience against future crises and to excel in a period of accelerated digital transformation, machine learning is the only way organizations can understand and act on the volumes of data we’re taking in, at the speed required to serve customers, outpace competitors, or fulfill their missions."

In this project, we consider the task of autonomous car racing in the top-selling car racing game Gran Turismo Sport. Gran Turismo Sport is known for its detailed physics simulation of various cars and tracks. Our approach makes use of maximum-entropy deep reinforcement learning and a new reward design to train a sensorimotor policy to complete a given race track as fast as possible. We evaluate our approach in  three different time trial settings with different cars and tracks. Our results show that the obtained controllers not only beat the built-in non-player character of Gran Turismo Sport, but also outperform the fastest known times in a dataset of personal best lap times of over 50,000 human drivers.

Machine Learning research is in dire straits as more people flood into the field and competent reviewers are scarce and overloaded. This video takes a look at the incentive structures behind the current system and describes how they create a negative feedback loop. In the end, I'll go through some proposed solutions and add my own thoughts.

OUTLINE:
0:00 - Intro
1:05 - The ML Boom
3:10 - Author Incentives
7:00 - Conference Incentives
8:00 - Reviewer Incentives
13:10 - Proposed Solutions
17:20 - A Better Solution
23:50 - The Road Ahead

PS: If it is not entirely clear to anyone already, stealing ideas as a reviewer is against most conferences' code of ethics and I disapprove of any such behavior. I mention it because it is being done regularly and good luck proving it in any particular case.

About the Course

Edureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

GPT3 is the latest in language modelling from OpenAI and self-supervised learning seeks to understand the inherent underlying patterns of the data itself which can then be used for more specific tasks later. It can result in up to 1000x fewer labels being required and still achieve the same results as supervised learning.

118,Machine Learning with Phil,Science is BROKEN and Deep Learning is a DEAD END | Epic Rant,0.0,2020-08-01,UC58v9cLitc8VaCjrcKyAbrw,8240,,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7QBhBlBJzjI/maxresdefault.jpg,1920,1080,Education,replication crisis in science|replication crisis|deep learning|artificial intelligence|why has scientific progress slowed down|climate models,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58v9cLitc8VaCjrcKyAbrw,"Science is often seen as being above the influences of the less desirable elements of human behavior. Nothing could be further from the truth. Scientists are human, and therefore respond to incentives the same way as any other human. A collection of broken incentives have completely busted science as an institutional endeavor, and artificial intelligence is no exception.

In particular, the quest to design artificial intelligence by reverse engineering the human brain will, in my opinion, fail. Of course, deep learning has numerous use cases that make it worthwhile to study, but as a route to achieving the world'st first artificial general intelligence, it's a dead end. The reason is that reverse engineering human brain function completely ignores the evolutionary context in which the human brain came about. We will be unable to achieve a nuanced enough understanding to get around this, at least that's what I'm predicting.

It's time for artificial intelligence researchers to go back to the drawing board and approach the problem from first principles. What, precisely, is a general intelligence? What are the minimum requirements for such a system? 

Just my opinion. Leave yours in the comments below.

The PS5 patent references the ability for the system to

""Techniques for automatically generating images by machine learning are being researched. As one of such attempts, a method of generating an image that reproduces the same target object by using a plurality of captured images obtained by shooting a target object such as a person as teacher data has been studied.""

This patent, however, seems to more reference a machine learning model rather than a machine learning inference, which is what you would assume is occurring if it's running an AI upsampling technology for increasing the resolution of a game similar to Nvidia's DLSS technology. Also, there are references for removing a character from the background using this particular patent too. 

There are also multiple references for the camera and acquiring images via it for processing. Sony's Playstation 5 for games technology likely has a similar compute based functionality to the Xbox series x, but not dedicated AI hardware blocks like Nvidia's tensor core technology found on Ampere, Turing or Volta.

Given the composibility of Julia, many have noted that it is positioned as the best language for this set of numerical techniques, but how to do actually ""do"" SciML? This workshop gets your hands dirty.

In this workshop we'll dive into some of the latest techniques in scientific machine learning, including Universal Differential Equations (Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning), Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Physics-informed neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations), and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SInDy, Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems). The goal is to get those in the workshop familiar with what these methods are, what kinds of problems they solve, and know how to use Julia packages to implement them.

The workshop will jump right into how to model the missing part of a physical simulation, describe how universal approximators (neural networks) can be used in this context, and show how to transform such problems into an optimization problem which is then accelerated by specializing automatic differentiation. The set of packages that is involved in this is somewhat intense, using many tools from JuliaDiffEq (DiffEqFlux.jl, DifferentialEquations.jl, DiffEqSensitivity.jl, ModelingToolkit.jl, NeuralPDE.jl, DataDrivenDiffEq.jl, Surrogates.jl, etc.) combined with machine learning tools (Flux.jl), differentiation tooling (SparseDiffTools.jl, Zygote.jl, ForwardDiff.jl, ReverseDiff.jl, etc.), and optimization tooling (JuMP, Optim.jl, Flux.jl, NLopt.jl, etc.) all spun together in a glorious soup that automatically discovers physical laws at the end of the day. Thus this workshop has something different to offer for everyone: new users of Julia will get a nice overview of the unique composibility of the Julia package ecosystem, while experienced Julia users will learn how to bridge some area that they are comfortable with (such as machine learning) to a whole new set of phenomena. Meanwhile, even though who are only knee deep in coding can gain a lot from learning these new mathematical advances, meaning that even a casual observer likely has a lot to learn!

Creating a machine learning algorithm ultimately means building a model that outputs correct information, given that we’ve provided input data. 

Think of this model as a black box. We feed input, and it delivers an output. For instance, we may want to create a model that predicts the weather tomorrow, given meteorological information for the past few days. The input we’ll feed to the model could be metrics, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. The output we will obtain would be the weather forecast for tomorrow. 

Training is a central concept in machine learning, as this is the process through which the model learns how to make sense of the input data. Once we have trained our model, we can simply feed it with data and obtain an output.

And what are the responsibilities of technologists who work in this area? In this talk, Chongli Qin and Iason Gabriel explore these questions — connected through the lens of responsible innovation — in two parts. In the first part, Chongli explores the question of why and how we can design algorithms that are safe, reliable and trustworthy through the lens of specification driven machine learning. In the second part, Iason looks more closely at ethical dimensions of machine learning, at the responsibility of researchers, and at processes that can structure ethical deliberation in this domain. Taken together, they suggest that there are important measures that we can, and should, put in place — if we want to build systems that are beneficial to society.

Speaker Bios: 

Chongli Qin is a research scientist at DeepMind, her primary interest is in building safer, more reliable and more trustworthy machine learning algorithms. Over the past several years, she has contributed in developing algorithms to make neural networks more robust to noise. Key parts of her research focuses on functional analysis: properties of neural network that can naturally enhance robustness. She has also contributed in building mathematical frameworks to verify/guarantee that certain properties hold for neural networks. Prior to DeepMind, Chongli studied in Cambridge, where she studied the mathematics tripos and scientific computing before doing a PhD in bioinformatics. 

Iason Gabriel is a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind where he works in the ethics research team. His work focuses on the applied ethics of artificial intelligence, human rights, and the question of how to align technology with human values. Before joining DeepMind, Iason was a Fellow in Politics at St John’s College, Oxford, and a member of the Centre for the Study of Social Justice (CSSJ). He holds a doctorate in Political Theory from the University of Oxford and spent a number of years working for the United Nations in post-conflict environments.

About the lecture series: 

The Deep Learning Lecture Series is a collaboration between DeepMind and the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence. Over the past decade, Deep Learning has evolved as the leading artificial intelligence paradigm providing us with the ability to learn complex functions from raw data at unprecedented accuracy and scale. Deep Learning has been applied to problems in object recognition, speech recognition, speech synthesis, forecasting, scientific computing, control and many more. The resulting applications are touching all of our lives in areas such as healthcare and medical research, human-computer interaction, communication, transport, conservation, manufacturing and many other fields of human endeavour. In recognition of this huge impact, the 2019 Turing Award, the highest honour in computing, was awarded to pioneers of Deep Learning.

In this lecture series, research scientists from leading AI research lab, DeepMind, deliver 12 lectures on an exciting selection of topics in Deep Learning, ranging from the fundamentals of training neural networks via advanced ideas around memory, attention, and generative modelling to the important topic of responsible innovation."

After introducing this framework along with the concept of inference, which is central to it, Andriy focuses on two types of modern latent variable models: invertible models and intractable models. Special emphasis is placed on understanding variational inference as a key to training intractable latent variable models.

Note this lecture was originally advertised as lecture 9.

Abstract:
We develop a general approach to distill symbolic representations of a learned deep model by introducing strong inductive biases. We focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The technique works as follows: we first encourage sparse latent representations when we train a GNN in a supervised setting, then we apply symbolic regression to components of the learned model to extract explicit physical relations. We find the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself. Our approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.

It is also arguably the least developed branch. Its goal is to find a parsimonious description of the input data by uncovering and exploiting its hidden structures. This is presumed to be more reminiscent of how the brain learns compared to supervised learning. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that the representations discovered through unsupervised learning may alleviate many known problems with deep supervised and reinforcement learning. However, lacking an explicit ground truth goal to optimise towards, developmental progress in unsupervised learning has been slow. In this talk DeepMind Research Scientist Irina Higgins and DeepMind Research Engineer Mihaela Rosca give an overview the historical role of unsupervised representation learning and difficulties with developing and evaluating such algorithms. They then take a multidisciplinary approach to think about what might make a good representation and why, before doing a broad overview of the current state of the art approaches to unsupervised representation learning.

About the lecture series: 

The Deep Learning Lecture Series is a collaboration between DeepMind and the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence. Over the past decade, Deep Learning has evolved as the leading artificial intelligence paradigm providing us with the ability to learn complex functions from raw data at unprecedented accuracy and scale. Deep Learning has been applied to problems in object recognition, speech recognition, speech synthesis, forecasting, scientific computing, control and many more. The resulting applications are touching all of our lives in areas such as healthcare and medical research, human-computer interaction, communication, transport, conservation, manufacturing and many other fields of human endeavour. In recognition of this huge impact, the 2019 Turing Award, the highest honour in computing, was awarded to pioneers of Deep Learning.

In this lecture series, research scientists from leading AI research lab, DeepMind, deliver 12 lectures on an exciting selection of topics in Deep Learning, ranging from the fundamentals of training neural networks via advanced ideas around memory, attention, and generative modelling to the important topic of responsible innovation."

In their most basic form, they consist of two ""competing"" networks: a generator which tries to produce data resembling a given data distribution (e.g., images), and a discriminator which predicts whether its inputs come from the real data distribution or from the generator, guiding the generator to produce increasingly realistic samples as it learns to ""fool"" the discriminator more effectively. This lecture discusses the theory behind these models, the difficulties involved in optimising them, and theoretical and empirical improvements to the basic framework. It also discusses state-of-the-art applications of this framework to other problem formulations (e.g., CycleGAN), domains (e.g., video and speech synthesis), and their use for representation learning (e.g., VAE-GAN hybrids, bidirectional GAN).

Note: this lecture was originally advertised as number 11 in the series.

Speaker Bio: 

Felix Hill is a Research Scientist working on grounded language understanding, and has been at DeepMind for almost 4 years. He studied pure maths as an undergrad, then got very interested in linguistics and psychology after reading the PDP books by McClelland and Rumelhart, so started graduate school at the University of Cambridge, and ended up in the NLP group. To satisfy his interest in artificial neural networks, he visited Yoshua Bengio's lab in 2013 and started a series of collaborations with Kyunghyun Cho and Yoshua applying neural nets to text processing. This led to some of the first work on transfer learning with sentence representations (and a neural crossword solver). He also interned at FAIR in NYC with Jason Weston. At DeepMind, he's worked on developing agents that can understand language in the context of interactive 3D worlds, together with problems relating to mathematical and analogical reasoning.

Dr. Yianni Gamvros, Head of Business Development at QC Ware
Mr. Vinay Phadnis, Instructor at Udemy

MODERATOR:
Dr. Terrill Frantz, Professor at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology

Most people think that practical QML is not attainable in the next decade because of QRAM requirements and hardware requirements for linear algebra. At the same time, proposals for using variational architectures to mimic neural nets have yet to deliver any proof of performance. Yianni will talk about QC Ware's unique approach to QML and provide some insights into the work we are pursuing and why it is important for practical QML.

- Dr. Gamvros (QC Ware Corp)

Tough problems need a mix of computing solutions to meet the demands of our increasingly complex and growing computational needs. Financial, energy, and aerospace companies are already looking to quantum computing as a potential new tool to help address problems that would be practically intractable for classical computers to solve alone. Michael will discuss how Rigetti’s hybrid quantum-classical computing systems are being used to explore new use cases, including quantum machine learning. By adding quantum computers to an already heterogeneous compute environment, we may be able to improve time to solution and other performance metrics for some machine learning algorithms.

- Mr. Michael Brett (Rigetti)

Quantum Machine Learning has always been considered as something which has a steep learning curve. In reality, the fundamental ideas of Quantum Machine learning are very simple to understand. This talk will cover some of the basic ideologies and concepts of Quantum Machine Learning paradigm along with many real life applications. Through these applications, I will try to first explain the need for Quantum Machine Learning and then build on some of the core concepts of Quantum Machine Learning like Directional Computing, Hybrid Computing etc.

Sobre o curso:

A curso de Intro to Deep Learning aborda aspectos fundamentais de redes neurais, desde o modelo básico do perceptron, até modelo generativos. Seguindo uma linha de tempo histórica das redes neurais os conceitos vão sendo introduzidos a medida do necessário para entendimento da evolução dessa área. O modelos baseados em deep learning podem ser aplicados a problemas de reconhecimento de objetos, reconhecimento de voz, síntese de fala, previsão, computação científica, controle e muito mais. As aplicações resultantes desses modelos tem afetando as nossas vidas em áreas como assistência médica e pesquisa médica, interação homem-computador, comunicação, transporte, conservação, manufatura e muitos outros campos do esforço humano. Em reconhecimento a esse enorme impacto, o Prêmio Turing de 2018, a maior honra em computação, foi concedido aos pioneiros do Deep Learning.

O curso é baseado, com algumas modificações, nos originais do prof Dr. Sebastian Raschka e podem ser encontrados em http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~sraschka/teaching/. Ambos os materiais (original prof Sebastian e adaptado prof Dalcimar) possuem licença modelo MIT, disponivel no Github.

If you’re interested in learning about machine learning and MLflow, this workshop series is for you!

Workshop 1 of 3 | Introduction to MLflow: How to Use MLflow Tracking

Level: Beginner/Intermediate Data Scientist or ML Engineer

Details: This workshop is an introduction to MLflow. Machine Learning (ML) development brings many new complexities beyond the traditional software development lifecycle. Unlike in traditional software development, ML developers want to try multiple algorithms, tools and parameters to get the best results, and they need to track this information to reproduce work. In addition, developers need to use many distinct systems to productionize models.

To solve these challenges, MLflow (https://mlflow.org/), an open source project, simplifies the entire ML lifecycle. MLflow introduces simple abstractions to package reproducible projects, track results, encapsulate models that can be used with many existing tools, and central repository to share models, accelerating the ML lifecycle for organizations of any size.

What you will learn: Understand the four main components of open source MLflow—MLflow Tracking, MLflow Projects, MLflow Models, and Model Registry—and how each component helps address challenges of the ML lifecycle.

- How to use MLflow Tracking to record and query experiments: code, data, config, and results. (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html)

- How to use MLflow Projects packaging format to reproduce runs. (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html)

- How to use MLflow Models general format to send models to diverse deployment tools. (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html)

- How to use Model Registry for collaborative model lifecycle management. (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html)

- How to use MLflow UI to visually compare and contrast experimental runs with different tuning parameters and evaluate metrics. (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking-ui)

But cracking interviews are not. This series is designed to target the concept which can help in cracking machine learning interviews. 

Gradient Descent is a process of finding a minimum of a function. This concept is heavily asked during machine learning and data science interviews and we should know the mathematics behind it. This video focuses on what is gradient descent, regression problem, cost function, loss function, learning rate, and way to find a minimum of a function using gradient descent. If you are not familiar with calculus, we will recommend watching this video first. This video will end up with some questions which can also be asked during the interview. These questions are covered during the concept explained in the video.

Derivative for Gradient Descent (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnMF6xtJv2Y). 
The derivative is the basis for machine learning knowledge. This topic is huge and we are not covering it in much detail here. We are only covering what is derivative, power rule, chain rule, and partial derivative. These are necessary to understand gradient descent."

Why machine learning is important?

Machine learning might just be one of the most important fields of science that we are just moving towards. It differs from other science in the sense that this is one of the one domains where the input and output are not directly correlated and neither do we provide the input for every task that the machine will perform. It is more about mimicking how humans think and solving real world problems like humans without actually the intervention of humans. It focuses on developing computer programs that can be taught to grown and change when exposed to data.

Facebook Ads Machine Learning has been the talk of 2019 and the experts say it's not going anywhere anytime soon. Is it really what it’s cracked up to be? Savannah Sanchez is a firm believer in using CBO. In her mind, the “Power 5” has challenged everything we know about media buying. She has seen her agency spend $100M+ this year utilising Facebook’s Machine Learning capabilities. Everything from CBO, automatic placements, dynamic creatives, and more.

Savannah has conducted an experiment split-testing CBO against a seasoned media buyer. She'll be revealing the results live on stage at AWA19. Come find out if automation is the answer to media buying at scale on Facebook. After sharing the results, Savannah will share the exact account structure and creative-testing process she used to scale accounts above 100k/month using CBO. Expert vs. machine...who will win?

Speech by Savannah Sanchez
Founder, The Social Savannah

Savannah Sanchez is the founder of the ad consultancy agency, The Social Savannah. The Social Savannah helps ecommerce brands scale through Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Google advertising. She currently works with some of the top online brands for their ad campaigns, spending over $10M on ads each year. Savannah enjoys teaching others her profitable ad buying methodology, which relies heavily on machine learning and robust creative testing to scale ad accounts.

The people that are fighting this disease need a solution now, not a year from now. As such, I'm hosting a 2-week $3500 Coronavirus Deep Learning Competition for anyone in this community to participate. The goal is to use deep learning to find a potential cure or treatment, then we'll send samples of the compound to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for further analysis. This is the perfect opportunity to show the world how open-source, community-driven AI can effect positive, relevant change. This is the AI-Human collaborative ""Deep Blue"" moment, a moment where, given AI tools, a human or group of humans will be able to accomplish an extraordinary feat that they couldn't otherwise. In this episode, I'll explain the details of the competition, the details of the Coronavirus genome, which teams are currently using AI to fight it, and we'll go through the necessary steps to generate and test candidate molecules with deep learning and PyRX (molecular docking software).

Physical human simulation holds the promise of unlocking unprecedented levels of interaction and variety to game animation. The incredibly intricate relations between a character and its environment can only be faithfully realized if we trust the physics solver as the ground truth of what is happening in the virtual world. On the other hand, modern data-driven methods such as Motion Matching have shown that it is possible to responsively control a character while preserving the details of a motion-captured style.
Using Deep Reinforcement Learning, we can now play Motion Matching on a physically simulated character. We believe that this result is an interesting step on the path towards believable and engaging virtual humans."

MAT shows the very promising and intriguing results on the several molecule property prediction tasks and also paves the way for more adaptation of deep learning approaches in chemistry research. This video introduces the model architecture and analyzes why it is so effective.

The paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08264
The official implementation: https://github.com/gmum/MAT


Abstract
Designing a single neural network architecture that performs competitively across a range of molecule property prediction tasks remains largely an open challenge, and its solution may unlock a widespread use of deep learning in the drug discovery industry. To move towards this goal, we propose Molecule Attention Transformer (MAT). Our key innovation is to augment the attention mechanism in Transformer using inter-atomic distances and the molecular graph structure. Experiments show that MAT performs competitively on a diverse set of molecular prediction tasks. Most importantly, with a simple self-supervised pretraining, MAT requires tuning of only a few hyperparameter values to achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks. Finally, we show that attention weights learned by MAT are interpretable from the chemical point of view."

Previous Versions of this course: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10601/previous.html

Course Overview:
Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience (e.g., programs that learn to recognize human faces, recommend music and movies, and drive autonomous robots). This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. We cover topics such as Bayesian networks, decision tree learning, Support Vector Machines, statistical learning methods, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The course covers theoretical concepts such as inductive bias, the PAC learning framework, Bayesian learning methods, margin-based learning, and Occam’s Razor. Programming assignments include hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the methodologies, technologies, mathematics, and algorithms currently needed by people who do research in machine learning.

10-301 and 10-601 are identical. Undergraduates must register for 10-301 and graduate students must register for 10-601.

Learning Outcomes: By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Implement and analyze existing learning algorithms, including well-studied methods for classification, regression, structured prediction, clustering, and representation learning
- Integrate multiple facets of practical machine learning in a single system: data preprocessing, learning, regularization and model selection
- Describe the formal properties of models and algorithms for learning and explain the practical implications of those results
- Compare and contrast different paradigms for learning (supervised, unsupervised, etc.)
- Design experiments to evaluate and compare different machine learning techniques on real-world problems
- Employ probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and optimization in order to develop new predictive models or learning methods
- Given a description of an ML technique, analyze it to identify: 
(1) the expressive power of the formalism; 
(2) the inductive bias implicit in the algorithm; 
(3) the size and complexity of the search space; 
(4) the computational properties of the algorithm: 
(5) any guarantees (or lack thereof) regarding termination, convergence, correctness, accuracy, or generalization power."

I wanted to see just how cheap a deep learning PC could be built for in 2020, so I did some research and put together a deep learning PC build containing brand new parts that comes out to about 450 US dollars. I chose NewEgg for the parts because it has a global shipping policy, deep learning belongs to the world not just the United States. In this episode, I’m going to walk you through what the deep learning stack looks like (CUDA, Jupyter, PyTorch, etc.) , why i chose the various hardware components, and then I’ll show you how to setup the full deep learning software stack on your PC.

https://didatica.tech/introducao-a-redes-neurais-e-deep-learning/

Basicamente, uma rede neural é uma estrutura que reúne pequenas unidades de computação (os chamados neurônios) de forma organizada, permitindo que a combinação dos cálculos realizados por cada neurônio resulte em soluções para problemas complexos. 
Cada neurônio em uma rede neural densa (totalmente conectada) realiza operações matemáticas simples de soma e multiplicação, e nessas operações, muitas variáveis precisam ser calibradas. 
Uma rede neural geralmente inicia seu treinamento com pesos e bias aleatórios, e vai aprendendo rapidamente como calibrar essas variáveis até que a resposta de saída seja a desejada para problemas de classificação ou de regressão.

This is a computational method for finding the minimum point on a function.

At what value of x we have minimum y.

The situation at which this method is useful is discussed in the previous discussion.


Let's take an example and understand how gradient descent works.

Take function y=(x-1)^2 +1.

Before going to concept lets refresh some of the concepts.

Derivative gives the slope of a function at a given point.

Slope means a change in y /change in x.

The slope is +ve if the increase in x at a given point y also increase

The slope is -ve if the increase in x at a given point y decrease

To identify the minimum point.

Randomly select an x value. Here we are selecting x=5

Derivative of the function is dy/dx=2x-2.

substitute 5 in the derivative equation ie 2*5 -2 =8.

so slope at x =5  is 8

+ve slope means x increase y increase.

Understand we have to identify the minimum y value. Ie reduce x value.

Lets take x= -5.

At x=-5 slope = 2*-5 -2 = -12.

The slope is -ve means x increase y decrease.

Y moving towards minimum. So increase x.

To meet the above conditions gradient descent uses the equation xnew = xold - alpha*[dy/dx] xold.

Check the above equation if the slope is +ve we subtracting from xold value ie decreasing x value.

If the slope is -ve than -ve * -ve we get +ve means we are adding value to xold. Increasing x value.

The above equation always push x value to the minimum y value.

Assume alpha = 0.2. we will understand why we use alpha at the end of the discussion.

We understand this wit an example

let's take x=5

so xold =5

find xnew value

xnew = xold – alpha*[dy/dx]xold  here xold = 5 dy/dx = 2x-2.

xnew = 5 – 0.2 * [2*5-2].

xnew = 5 – 0.2 * 8.

xnew = 5 – 1.6.

xnew = 3.4.

Observe from the above figure x moving to minimum y point.

Now xold = 3.4

again find xnew

xnew = xold – alpha [dy/dx]3.4

xnew = 3.4 – 0.2 * [(2 * 3.4) – 2]

xnew = 3.4 – 0.2 * 4.8

xnew = 3.4 – 0.96

snew = 2.44

again x moving near to minimum y value.

So keep repeating this computation till xnew value reaches minimum y value.

How we know x reaches to minimum y value.

Observe from the above figure when x reaches to point p1. When we find the xnew value at p1.

Xnew moves to p2 point. P2 is on the other side.

At p2 slope is -ve. So when we find xnew again at p2 we increase x value and move to p1 side again.

So x value swaps between xnew -xold value.change in value is very very small. And x value is not changing much.

This we call it convergence. Ie x moved to minimum y. we can stop computing.

Let's understand what's the use of alpha.

Lets take alpha = 0.4.

xnew = xold – alpha*[dy/dx]xold  here xold = 5 dy/dx = 2x-2.

xnew = 5 – 0.4 * [2*5-2].

xnew = 5 – 0.4 * 8.

xnew = 5 – 3.2.

xnew = 1.8.

Observe as the alpha value increased fro 0.2 to 0.4.

x value takes a long jump.

At alpha = .2 x jumped from 5 to 3.4.

at alpha = .4 x jumped from 5 to 1.8.

as alpha value increases x takes long jump ie x moves to minimum point very fast.

Convergence is fast with a big alpha.

But with large alpha, the problem is we can not have a better approximation.

Why not better approximation?

Observe from the above figure.

The point in red color. From there, its taking long jump means its moving to the other side.

Observe the x value swaps on both sides. And it's far from the actual minimum.

That's the reason large alpha doesn't have better approximations.

If needed better approximation use small alpha.

if needed fast convergence use large alpha.

This understanding of gradient descent will help a lot in Machine learning.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++, a programming language that after 34 years is still one of the most popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you're watching this on YouTube, many of the critical back-end component of YouTube are written in C++. Same goes for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, most Microsoft applications, Adobe applications, most database systems, and most physical systems that operate in the real-world like cars, robots, rockets that launch us into space and one day will land us on Mars.

Today, we're going to combine the artificial neuron we created last week into an artificial neural network. Artificial neural networks are better than other methods for more complicated tasks like image recognition, and the key to their success is their hidden layers. We'll talk about how the math of these networks work and how using many hidden layers allows us to do deep learning. Neural networks are really powerful at finding patterns in data which is why they've become one of the most dominant machine learning technologies used today.

The simulation was implemented using Unity's ML-Agents framework (https://unity3d.com/machine-learning). The AI consists of a deep Neural Network with 3 hidden layers of 128 neurons each. It is trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a Reinforcement Learning approach.

Basically, the input of the Neural Network are the readings of eight depth sensors, the car's current speed and position, as well as its relative position to the target. The outputs of the Neural Network are interpreted as engine force, braking force and turning force. These outputs can be seen at the top right corner of the zoomed out camera shots.

The AI starts off with random behaviour, i.e. the Neural Network is initialized with random weights. It then gradually learns to solve the task by reacting to environment feedback accordingly. The environment tells the AI whether it is doing good or bad with positive or negative reward signals.
In this project, the AI is rewarded with small positive signals for getting closer to the parking spot, which is outlined in red, and gets a larger reward when it actually reaches the parking spot and stops there. The final reward for reaching the parking spot is dependent on how parallel the car stops in relation to the actual parking position. If the car stops in a 90° angle to the actual parking direction for instance, the AI will only be rewarded a very small amount, relative to the amount it would get for stopping completely parallel to the actual direction.
The AI is penalized with a negative reward signal, when it either drives further away from the parking spot or if it crashes into any obstacles.

The training process shown in this video took about 23 hours on a computer with an i5 (7th or 8th gen) and a GTX 1070 with 100x simulation speed.

We will understand the problem of a real estate company from its CEO and then apply ML to solve it. I have tried to make this video interactive and interesting by adding cartoon characters/animations. In this project I will be walking you through analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more. At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. I will teach you how concepts like cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action. Indeed a very long video but packed with my years of learning!

The idea is that doing any kind of task related to machine learning involves a whole lot of steps like cleaning a dataset, choosing a model, deciding what the right configurations of that model should be, deciding what the most relevant features are etc. The goal of AutoML is to automate all of that up to a point where all a data scientist would need to do is tell a machine to perform some task using a dataset and wait for it to learn how by itself. In this episode, i'm going to explain several popular AutoML techniques, then compare top AutoML frameworks like AutoKeras, Auto Sklearn, h20, Ludwig, etc. to help you decide which one will be the best for your needs.

This process can be applied to any deep learning paper, not just deep reinforcement learning.

In the second part, you will learn how to code a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent using Python and PyTorch, to beat the continuous lunar lander environment (a classic machine learning problem).

DDPG combines the best of Deep Q Learning and Actor Critic Methods into an algorithm that can solve environments with continuous action spaces. We will have an actor network that learns the (deterministic) policy, coupled with a critic network to learn the action-value functions. We will make use of a replay buffer to maximize sample efficiency, as well as target networks to assist in algorithm convergence and stability.

In this course, we will learn to implement a lot of things that are inside Fastai and PyTorch. We will learn things that we could use to build our own deep learning libraries. Along the way, we will learn to implement papers, which is an important skill to master when making state of the art models.

In today's lesson we'll discuss the purpose of this course, which is, in some ways, the opposite of part 1. This time, we're not learning practical things that we will use right away, but are learning foundations that you can build on. This is particularly important nowadays because this field is moving so fast. We'll also talk about why the last two lessons of this course are about Swift, not Python (Chris Lattner, the original creator of Swift, and now lead of Swift for TensorFlow, will be joining Jeremy to co-teach these lessons).

We'll also discuss the structure of this course, which is extremely ""bottom up"" (whereas part 1 was extremely ""top down""). We'll start from the lowest level foundations (matrix multiplication) and gradually build back up to state of the art models.

We'll gradually refactor and accelerate our first, pure python, matrix multiplication, and in the process will learn about broadcasting and einstein summation. We'll then use this to create a basic neural net forward pass, and in the process will start looking at how neural networks are initialized (a topic we'll be going into in great depth in the coming lessons).

Then we will implement the backwards pass, including a brief refresher of the chain rule (which is really all the backwards pass is). We'll then refactor the backwards path to make it more flexible and concise, and finally we'll see how this translates to how PyTorch actually works."

7:15 O futuro do machine learning

Basicamente, o machine learning é a técnica de aprender com a experiência. Ou seja, a partir de muitas tentativas, o algoritmo mantém salvo um histórico daquilo que funciona e daquilo que não funciona, e vai evoluindo a cada nova iteração. No início, o programa apenas sabe as regras, e com o treinamento ele vai aprendendo por conta própria as estratégias.

In this part, we're going to focus on Q-Learning.

Q-Learning is a model-free form of machine learning, in the sense that the AI ""agent"" does not need to know or have a model of the environment that it will be in. The same algorithm can be used across a variety of environments.

For a given environment, everything is broken down into ""states"" and ""actions."" The states are observations and samplings that we pull from the environment, and the actions are the choices the agent has made based on the observation. For the purposes of the rest of this tutorial, we'll use the context of our environment to exemplify how this works.

Iceberg lettuce is one such crop. Although it is the most common type of lettuce grown in the UK, iceberg is easily damaged and grows relatively flat to the ground, presenting a challenge for robotic harvesters. 

The ‘Vegebot’, developed by a team at the University of Cambridge, was initially trained to recognise and harvest iceberg lettuce in a lab setting. It has now been successfully tested in a variety of field conditions in cooperation with G’s Growers, a local fruit and vegetable co-operative. 

Although the prototype is nowhere near as fast or efficient as a human worker, it demonstrates how the use of robotics in agriculture might be expanded, even for crops like iceberg lettuce which are particularly challenging to harvest mechanically."

Abstract: Connector insertion and many other tasks commonly found in modern manufacturing settings involve complex contact dynamics and friction. Since it is difficult to capture related physical effects with first-order modeling, traditional control methodologies often result in brittle and inaccurate controllers, which have to be manually tuned. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been demonstrated to be capable of learning controllers in such environments from autonomous interaction with the environment, but running RL algorithms in the real world poses sample efficiency and safety challenges. Moreover, in practical real-world settings we cannot assume access to perfect state information or dense reward signals. In this paper, we consider a variety of difficult industrial insertion tasks with visual inputs and different natural reward specifications, namely sparse rewards and goal images. We show that methods that combine RL with prior information, such as classical controllers or demonstrations, can solve these tasks from a reasonable amount of real-world interaction."

Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live, and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now, let us deep dive into this short video on Machine learning and understand the basics of Machine Learning.

Below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? (00:52)
2. What is Supervised Learning? (01:25)
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? (01:52)
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? (02:25)
5. Simplilearn's Machine Learning certification course (03:54)

#Data_science_tamil #categorical_data #Machine_learning_Python_tamil

*In this session we will understand in detail about handling the categorical data with hands-on using python and Spyder IDE in Tamil. 

We will use Pandas , Numpy , sklearn library for handling the categorical values.

* As a first step, we will use the Label encoder from sklearn preprocessing library for converting the categorical text data into numerical data. 

* Next we will convert the Label encoded data into ones and zeros using OneHot Encoder class in sklearn library.This will help the ML Algorithm to give equal weightage to the text variable.

* After applying the class OneHot encoder , we have got into dummy variable trap and to get eliminate the dummy variable trap. We need to remove the first column of the OneHot Encoder output. 

Thus these are the simple steps through which we will be able to convert the categorical text  variable into numerical data.

In machine learning most of the time will be spend on data preprocessing , data mining and feature extraction . Hence please listen to this topic more carefully .

*This is a Data science course . This is a full fledge course for free and we will cove all the main topics on the machine learning algorithm. This course is specifically designed to address all the queries from beginners to expert . Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is a bigger umbrella ,In that  Machine learning ( ML ) and Deep Learning ( DL ) are part of Artificial Intelligence.   

*In this video we will have an overview on the topics that will be covered. On high level it will be 

*Data Preprocessing
*Supervised Learning - Algorithm 
    *Classification
    *Regression
    *Association 
*Unsupervised learning - Algorithm
    *Clustering
    *Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
*Semi -Supervised learning
*Re- Enforcement learning
*Best approach for Model selection
*Intro to Deep Learning

The above topics will be covered in-detail on the upcoming session which you can find it in the below playlist .

Machine learning (ML) is the study of algorithms and mathematical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.[1][2]:2 Machine learning algorithms are used in the applications of email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[3][4] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.

457,SNU BioRobotics Lab,A New Intention Detection Method using Machine Learning with Exo-Glove Poly II,1.0,2019-01-30,BioroboticsSNU,2616,,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Bif0RTdRKDw/maxresdefault.webp,1920,1080,Science & Technology,,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xtOGkcUAb4GA4zJE8KgBg,"Professor Sungho Jo (KAIST) and Kyu-Jin Cho (Seoul National University), a collaboration research team in Soft Robotics Research Center (SRRC), Seoul, Korea, have proposed a new intention detection paradigm for soft wearable hand robots. The proposed paradigm predicts grasping/releasing intentions based on user behaviors, enabling the spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with lost hand mobility to pick-and-place objects. (The researchers include (KAIST) Daekyum Kim & Jeesoo Ha, (Seoul National University) Brian Byunghyun Kang, Kyu Bum Kim & Hyungmin Choi) 
They developed a method based on a machine learning algorithm that predicts user intentions for wearable hand robots by utilizing a first-person-view camera. Their development is based on the hypothesis: user intentions can be inferred through the collection of user arm behaviors and hand-object interactions. 
The machine learning model used in this study, Vision-based Intention Detection network from an EgOcentric view (VIDEO-Net), is designed based on this hypothesis. VIDEO-Net is composed of spatial and temporal sub-networks, where the temporal sub-network is to recognize user arm behaviors and the spatial sub-network is to recognize hand-object interactions. 
An SCI patient wearing Exo-Glove Poly II, a soft wearable hand robot, successfully pick-and-place various objects and perform essential activities of daily living, such as drinking coffee without any additional helps.
Their development is advantageous in that it detects user intentions without requiring any person-to-person calibrations and additional actions. This enables the wearable hand robot to interact with humans seamlessly."

About the Course

Edureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow. In addition, you will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders. 

Delve into neural networks, implement Deep Learning algorithms, and explore layers of data abstraction with the help of this Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

In this video, we’ll be introducing the idea of Q-learning with value iteration, which is a reinforcement learning technique used for learning the optimal policy in a Markov Decision Process. 

We'll illustrate how this technique works by introducing a game where a reinforcement learning agent tries to maximize points, and through this, we’ll also learn about Q-tables and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

- Very nice web layout
- Maybe keep it to one scrollable page
- Love the about me, perfect place to put it and cute dog
- Cool to see someone pursuing this career after going back to school
- Key thing is he is transitioning, not jumping
- No age for data science

Resume 
- I like the digital resume, but maybe a pdf or picture of a traditional one would make more sense here
- I don't love the *** scale. For me this is usually a box to check (Can he do this, we will find out his aptitude later) One thing I've found is that people have no clue how to judge their own ability
- More expansion on the types of skills
- Love how he talks about his projects and what he is doing
- Don't see a need for the soft skills section

Linkedin 
- More connections
- Share work here

In almost every data science interview I have had, I have talked about at least one of these projects. 

Data science project 1: Basketball season win total prediction 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_SMU701qlA
Data science project 2:  RNN to predict the price of crypto currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfRhKHV8-t4
Data science project 3: UFC decision classifier
Data science project 4: Golfer cluster analysis 

As you can see, all of these data science projects were on subjects interesting to me. While not all of them were successful, I was able to articulate their pitfalls and was able to clearly explain the possible next steps. I was also extremely focused on the outcome and who would be using the research.

The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

Setup!
Github source code & data: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks 
Installing Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html 
Installing Pandas library: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

Detailed video description! (timeline can be found in comments)

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

The field of data analytics is quite large and what you might be aiming to do with it is likely to never match up exactly to any tutorial. With that in mind, I think the best way for us to approach learning data analysis with Python is simply by example. My plan here is to find some datasets and do some of the common data analysis tasks, using the Pandas package, to hopefully get you familiar enough with the package to work with it on your own.

Let me know if you have any questions!

In this video we walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library. We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)

I realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.

If you enjoyed this video, be sure to throw it a like and make sure to subscribe to not miss any future videos!

A good understanding of customers is extremely important for running a successful business. KYC or ‘know your customer’ is what actually makes all the difference for many companies. KYC helps them do their best in creating, communicating, and delivering their offerings by tailoring them to their customers’ needs. 

But understanding and meeting customers’ needs is easier said than done. Customer Analytics is a very broad area. It may include a wide range of characteristics of customers and their behavior and numerous different outcomes and performance indicators that the business might be interested in.

In this introductory course we will focus on the first part of one of the most fundamental marketing frameworks – that of segmentation, targeting, and positioning, known as the ‘S T P framework’.

The data we’ll use throughout the course come from a fast-moving consumer goods, or ‘F M C G’ company. A typical example of an ‘F M C G’ marketplace is a supermarket.  People visit supermarkets every day and most types of goods in-store are purchased daily, too. Therefore, we have lots and lots of data available, making ‘F M C G’ a perfect example for our customer analytics course.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Read on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the ""Join Competition button to create an account and gain access to the competition data. Then check out Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!

The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Once we have the basics, we will go deeper. Bit by bit, we will start unfolding the power of Combinatorics. We will explore Permutations, how to compute them, and how to apply them to real-life scenarios. We will take some extra time to clarify the difference between variations and permutations, which will be explained mathematically, graphically, and through real-life examples!

We will go over examples in each field which are impossible to comprehend without a solid understanding of the fundamentals of probability. 

Sounds great, doesn’t it?

Hello Friends Welcome back to the section on the data preprocessing. So in this tutorial we're going to see how to deal with the categorical data. So why categorical data we need to deal with? what is categorical data? So let's take our earlier example first. So I'm just going to print this X. So if you see here all those data which is not numeric in nature which is called the categorical data. So if you see here the first feature and a third feature which is having a value like Mumbai, London, New York Yes, No now all our machine learning algorithm can take only numerical data into account. So we just cannot throw all this Mumbai, London, New York, Yes, No, kind of data directly to machine learning algorithm we need to have some strategy to transform this non-numeric data into numeric data and then only we can process for the machine learning system design. Now if you see y, the output variable, that also contains a yes no yes no. So that is non-numeric in nature. So we should have some mechanism to transform this from one form into another form. So what are the strategies are there to transform into numeric nature? So one thing we can do whenever there two values are available or three values are available. So you see first feature there is only three features, or three different labels that are available either it's Mumbai, it's London or New York, this feature whether a particular person is smoking or not. It has only two possible values are there: yes or no and output also is 2 values. So you can transform like yes to let's say 1 and No to let's say 0. So that is one way we can do it, and in case of this Mumbai, London and New York. You can transform like Mumbai will transform to 0. London will transform to 1. So New York will transform into 2, so whenever there is two features are available. Your problem is almost get solved because either it's in a one direction or it's in the other direction especially in output value. So yes we will categorize to the 1 and we will supply to the machine learning algorithm and No will be categorized to the 0. But here there is one problem. Whenever you have a more than two features or more than two labels are available in a single feature. So here we have a total three values. Now if you supply this Mumbai as a 0, London as a 1 and New York as 2 It may happen the machine learning algorithm try to capture the relationship like London is better than Mumbai or New York is greater than London. But our intention is not to provide the data in such a way that algorithm will understand that London is greater than Mumbai because we are supplying 1 for London and a 0 for the Mumbai. New York is greater than London because New York is 2 And London is 1. So how to solve this problem? So first problem is just very simple mapping we will solve with label encoding. So we are going to use the label encoder but for the another, this first feature non-numeric to numeric conversion We just cannot allow for this kind of strategy. First we need to convert into label encoder. Then we should have a some other strategy like instead of transforming to just 0 1 and 2. What we will do we will just create three more features like first feature is like Mumbai, another one is London And the last one is New York. Now let's take all example one by one, so first feature is saying, first record is saying its person belongs"

Foi criado no contexto do projeto final da Aceleração em Data Science ofertada pela Codenation (agora Trybe).
Para esse projeto, um Sistema de Recomendação Content-Based baseado em Regressão Logística foi utilizado - as recomendações foram ordenadas e priorizadas com base na probabilidade estimada fornecida pelo algoritmo de classificação.
O dataset original contém 462298 empresas e 181 variáveis, incluindo ID.
Os portfólios de clientes contém 555, 566 e 265 clientes cada.
O sistema foi treinado e testado com um dos portfólios e forneceu MAP@3 = 1 e MAP@5 = 0.8, ou seja, empresas que já são clientes foram recomendadas primeiro, o que era o esperado. 

Finalmente, novas recomendações foram feitas e avaliadas em comparação com o dataset completo, revelando características interessantes do portfólio.

Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

Data science provides meaningful information based on large amounts of complex data or big data. Data science, or data-driven science, combines different fields of work in statistics and computation to interpret data for decision-making purposes.

By extrapolating and sharing these insights, data scientists help organizations to solve vexing problems. Combining computer science, modeling, statistics, analytics, and math skills—along with sound business sense—data scientists uncover the answers to major questions that help organizations make objective decisions.

Data science for business
Written by renowned data science experts Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett, Data Science for Business introduces the fundamental principles of data science, and walks you through the ""data-analytic thinking"" necessary for extracting useful knowledge and business value from the data you collect.

In this #jammingwithjason #internalauditpodcast I speak with Joe Oringel about some of the challenges #internalaudit is facing when it comes to #dataanalytics. It turns out one reason people struggle is not understanding the seven body of knowledge areas we should be focusing on and determining where you want to be.
We discuss personnel issues (e.g. do you hire a data scientist and teach them how to audit, or train internal auditors how to be a data scientist) and how to plan out your multi-year path on incorporating more data analytics into your audit activities.
If you are working to improve data analytics in your internal audit department, you need to listen to this episode.

Business analytics and data science have become important skills across all industries. Knowing both how to perform analytics, as well as, sense checking analyses and understanding concepts is key in making decisions today.

Python has become the lingua franca of data science and is, therefore, the topic of this class. 

Programming can be intimidating, however, Python excels due to its readability and being freely available for all platforms including Linux, Mac and Windows. This class will assume some prior knowledge of Python syntax, but to establish a common learning environment some of the basics will be covered. We will cover the full data science workflow including:

- Loading data from files (e.g. Excel tables) and databases (e.g. SQL servers)
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning
- Model validation and churn analysis
- Data visualization and report generation

In this class, we will use freely and openly available Python libraries including: Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn and you will also learn how to quickly learn new libraries.

We all have expectations and we base our expectations on the values learned from our parents and our community.
The same applies for corporations. Business leaders (or CEOs) aim to set up their companies in a profitable way. They expect to earn more money than the money that was initially invested by shareholders. They expect to grow, and – in addition to being profitable – business leaders want to meet and exceed customer expectations. 

In this course we will focus on objective expectations. Given that a company has multiple stakeholder groups with different and sometimes conflicting expectations, it is up to the CEO and the Board of Directors, to set the expectations. The CEO with his or her management team is responsible for the daily operations, while the board of directors is focused on the longer term, the strategy and vision for the company.

My tips for getting a data scientist job in 2020 are as follows:

1) Apply to FEWER jobs - do less, better
2) Have a portfolio (e.g. Github)
3) Know the right stuff for the job, and be honest about what you do and don't know
4) Use the storyboard technique  in the interview - when talking about past projects, describe the premise, problem, solution, and outcome
5) Don't be a robot!    Build a relationship with the people interviewing you!

I hope to help cut through the ambiguity associated with plagiarism in data science by clearly defining it, talking about how you can avoid it in your data science projects, and about some of the negative consequences associated with it. 

This is a cautionary tale. Plagiarism can have disastrous consequences, like for my fellow youtuber Siraj Raval. I hope that we can learn from others mistakes and avoid this type of behavior in the future.

In this video, we are interviewing Mayur Mittal who graduated last month(July  2020) from Monash University in the Master of Data Science course. 

Mayur as an international student from India had gotten a part-time job in Melbourne as a door to a door sales consultant. Later he got an internship through Monash University before his final semester. He worked extremely hard and turned that internship as an opportunity to secure a part-time job in the same company and later they offered him a full-time job. 

This is the first episode of this series where we are featuring international students. Hope you love the video and don't forget to like share and subscribe.

Стоит учитывать, что рассмотренные темы отлично применимы, если вы только начинаете свою карьеру в Data Science, либо уже имеете средний уровень. Рассмотренные вопросы касаются классического ML. Например, если вы занимаетесь Object Detection, то сверху у вас еще будут задания по соответствующей тематике. 

Ну и конечно на позицию Senior и Lead вы просто ОБЯЗАНЫ знать весь этот материал без каких-либо НО-ЕСЛИ-НЕ ПОМНЮ =) Их тоже спросят =)

I talk about the hardware components of a computer and how those relate to your data science performance. At the end, I give my thoughts on the best computer for you to purchase. 

The cpu is in charge of the processing power of the computer. It mostly controls how fast processing for normal data science operations is. 

The ram stands for random access memory. It determines how much data can be processed in a single batch.

You will also need a hard drive. I recommend stead state memory. This doesn't have much impact on performance of your models, so you don't need to go crazy here. This is the cheapest type of memory though so you can scale up at a low cost. 

The last main component that is relevant for data science is the GPU. NVIDIA recently sent me a Titan RTX, and I am excited to be experimenting with that in future videos. For deep learning, you should really have at least 6 gb of gpu memory. If you are playing graphics intensive games or editing videos, I recommend increasing this further. 

My final recommendation: Your computer really doesn't matter much. Data science is done mostly on the cloud making your computer relatively irrelevant. You have access to top of the line GPU's and even TPU's on kaggle.com or through google colab. In my opinion, the best computer for data science is the one that you can afford. 

If you still want to do something locally, I recommend the following requirements 

CPU (4 cores): Ryzen 5, 7, 9 should suffice
Ram: Minimum 8gb but 16 is preferred 
HD: 256gb
GPU: NVIDIA with 6+ GB of memory (4 + gb if if laptop)

My laptop: https://amzn.to/2W3Zh4E

Budget PC Parts

I walk you through some of the things that I do well and also some of the major problems with how I have put my data science resume together. Special thanks to Pranath for pointing out some of these errors! 

Resume Link: https://kennethjee.com/resume/

Things that I did well:
- Links up top 
- Exhaustive list of skills up top 
- Clear structure focused on work experience 

Thinks I did poorly:
- Grammatical errors (Unacceptable)
- Picture at the top
- Lack of projects and coursework 
- Poorly communicated project value 

Things I did that you shouldn't: 
- Picture on resume 
- Additional formatting
- Focus on management experience 

My resume is mostly decorative and would be focused more on a senior level or director level job. I recommend against using my resume as a template!

Data scientists leaving their jobs appears to be coming from the following key reasons:
1) Overall macro-economic expansion experienced between 2011-2020
2) Expectations not matching reality
3) Data scientists don't like playing politics
4) Being the ""go-to"" person for all things data related
5) Lack of upskilling opportunities"

Data Scientists Suck At Demand Planning! Or do they? Can they learn the required skills? Conversely, can demand planners learn new data science skills? I interview author of 'Data Science For Supply Chain Forecast', Nicholas Vandeput, and examine the differences and similarities between data scientists and demand planners, and how we need to learn from each other.

02:12 Forecast accuracy by university degree
04:30 Data scientists make horrible demand planners
06:16 Mindset of data scientists
07:35 Experimenting in data science
12:55 Differences between data scientist and demand planning roles
14:04 Will data scientists do the modeling then hand over to a demand planner?
16:45 Should we get data scientists into demand planning, or do we keep them as separate roles?
17:00 Human judgement, collaboration and data science
20:10 Will data science be part of supply chain or will demand planning be a data science function?
20:25 The value if an independent analytics function
25:48 The importance of knowing new models and techniques

Data Science. As you know,

you will come across three different areas when it is data science. One is software programming.

Second one is statistics.

Okay.

And the third one is algorithms

okay

for all these little things

but when you're when you're talking about tools in data science I'll say that also when you're talking about tools in data science, you are having three sets of books are Python answers.

Okay? Okay.

Okay.

You're learning data science, you will be able to go with two different designations oneness as a data analyst.

and other one is a data science

okay. So, when you're dealing with data analyst position, you have to know some things related to programming

and statistics

many are moving as a data scientist who should know how to analyse the data,

statistical

concepts and machine learning

that is over

okay that is machine learning

Okay.

All these things whether you go for a data analyst or whether you go for data scientists these are the tools

when

Making the art

you may not have any prior experience in programming languages if you don't have any technical knowledge also

I will be a little bit easier one it is a statistical programming language

okay

even though if you don't have any idea or programming languages you don't have any idea regarding the school also it's not a problem right from the beginning only we will be moving on right from the structure will be understanding

how to use the syntax all those items very straightforward. The programming language is very straightforward. It has a number of packages for even for statistical information also I'll come to that part what are the statistical things that you will be learning it in data science that also is it so that it will be easier for you to

like you can make up your mind altering that. So our needs it is not at all a problem.

If you don't have any prior experience in programming also it is not a bigger deal. But when you are talking about Python, it is something called object oriented programming language.

The syntax is a little bit complex.

So if you are going with Python, definitely you should have some idea of prior languages like C, c++ or Java or some kind of basic knowledge you should have in those things. I'm not saying like compulsively have a capacity to learn this particular Python language it is fine. Because it is logical and simpler disagree a little bit complex.

Right now only this developing.

Python is there for the development, other processing option, but when it comes to data science and communication options right now only we are entering Python so a number of practices are there and it is very helpful when it is more powerful than

But the problem in Python is the syntax is a little bit new.

So people might be finding it difficult from a non programming background

or from a non programming background. If you are taking Python is it will feel a little bit

but I'm not saying like you cannot cope up with that you can do it but you have to do a lot a lot of hard work.

Okay, that is for Python. The next tool is SAS.

SAS is something in an article

analytical and statistical

which is entirely different from R and Python. Even if you don't know any programming knowledge also no problem.

It will be very, it is entirely a visualisation process.

analyse it eventually, and then form your scripts, but you have to memorise certain

conditionals but it is very straightforward

even if you don't have any prior knowledge related to programming also no problem since you work

I mean they will do me

Yeah, yeah."

Although we take this realization for granted, we are still in the very early stage of enabling data teams to deliver on their promise. One of the reasons is that we haven’t equipped this profession with the modern toolkit they deserve.

Existing solutions leave data teams with impossible trade-offs. Giving Data Scientists the freedom to use any open source tools on their laptops doesn’t provide a clear path to production and governance. Simply hosting those same tools in the Cloud may solve some of the data privacy and security issues, but doesn’t improve productivity nor collaboration. On the other hand, most robust and scalable production environments hinder innovation and experimentation by slowing Data Scientists down.

In this talk, Clemens Mewald and Lauren Richie will unveil the next generation of the Databricks Data Science Workspace: An open and unified experience for modern data teams specifically designed to address these hard tradeoffs. We will introduce new features that leverage the open source tools you are familiar with to give you a laptop-like experience that provides the flexibility to experiment and the robustness to create reliable and reproducible production solutions.

But, just like in the California gold-rush – you can make money (add-value) by panning for gold, or you can make a good living selling buckets and shovels. Too often analytics gets side-tracked into providing models, dashboards, datasets etc. instead of monetizable insights. Why is this and how do you avoid it?

We held a virtual event with Nick Hall on 18th June 2020.

Key points covered:
• The importance of adding value through analytics
• Recognising the distinction of actually uncovering valuable insights (mining gold) versus building tools to help others do that (selling buckets)?
• Why it is so easy to get caught up in the “buckets business”?
• Why can it be dangerous / self-defeating (some war stories)?
• What can you do to ensure you are genuinely “mining for gold”?

Me siga no Instagram e receba dicas exclusivas: http://www.instagram.com/mariofilhoml

Quando eu descobri que precisava aprender matemática para estudar machine learning, fui procurar algum lugar onde eu pudesse aprender pela internet.

Comecei pelo curso de “Cálculo de Uma Variável” do MIT, mas logo percebi que não estava entendendo nada.

Então encontrei a Khan Academy.

A primeira coisa que precisei saber foi: o que eu ainda lembro do ensino médio? Talvez equações…

Fui ver o primeiro vídeo de equações de primeiro grau e tive dificuldade para entender já nos primeiros minutos.

Tudo bem, resolvi procurar algum assunto mais básico, para depois poder entender as equações.

Cheguei em potenciação e logaritmos, mas a experiência foi a mesma. Em poucos minutos de vídeo já estava tudo confuso.

Fui dando passos para trás, clicando, buscando vídeos mais básicos. 

Para você entender melhor: a Khan Academy organiza os materiais do mais fácil para o mais complicado.

Pode parecer mentira, mas eu fui voltando tanto que cheguei a um vídeo onde o professor explicava: “se eu tenho três maçãs e duas laranjas, quantas frutas eu tenho? cinco!”

Nessa hora eu pensei: “hmm, acho que essa parte eu já sei, vou para o próximo vídeo”

Engraçado, não é? Pode rir, foi o que eu fiz quando lembrei dessa história.

Agora eu te falo. Será que você sabe menos do que eu sabia na época? Não é possível.

Seja qual for o seu conhecimento atual, você pode aprender o bastante para conseguir estudar machine learning.

Eu sou a prova de que você não precisa ter talento para matemática para se dar bem em Data Science.

Quero te ajudar a traçar um plano neste vídeo."

We mostly identify a person in a photo with a face. Hence we will use opencv and a technique called haar cascades to detect if a face and two eyes are clearly visible or not. If they are than we keep the image otherwise we discard the image. Majority of the data cleaning work will be done using python code but there will be some cleaning work that we will have to do manually.

If companies are paying so high for data scientist jobs, it must be not very easy to become a data scientist. However many times people live in inferiority complex thinking that they are not good at math, statistics, or programming hence they can't become data scientist even though they have a passion in this field. My suggestion is to ask yourself ""have you followed the right resources to learn data science skills?"" For example, to learn math I always advise people to use these resources,
Great resources to learn math:
https://www.mathsisfun.com/
https://www.khanacademy.org/
3b1b youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw

Also for python programming, this tutorial playlist is something that even middle school student can follow along easily,
Python tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S

Other than following the right resources one needs to ask if you are right-brained or left-brained person. Are you interested in data science and analytical job? Data scientist job is so much in demand and there is a lot of competition so certainly, while it is not easy to become a data scientist if you are committed and ready to do hard work with a lot of discipline it is certainly not very hard as well.

How Do Digital Transformation, Business Models & Data Science Meet? Ganna Pogrebna interviews Professor Glenn Parry on his #career in #digitaltransformation as well as many other areas. We discuss how #DigitalTransformation, #BusinessModels, and #DataScience come together, how companies can decide whether #data science can add #value to their #business #strategy, and even how businesses can use #AI and data science to cope with #COVID. We also touch on #blockchain.

Professor Glenn Parry is the Chair in Digital Transformation at University of Surrey and was formally Professor of Strategy and Operations Management at Bristol Business School, UWE and senior visiting fellow with the University of Bath, UK. Professor Parry was founding Speciality Chief Editor of Frontiers in Blockchain - Blockchain for Good with Dr Richard Adams and Dr Jane Thomason. He has over 70 peer reviewed journal publications and the textbooks titled Service Design and Delivery, Build to Order: The Road to the 5 day Car and ''Complex Engineering Service Systems'' - all published by Springer.

Acurácia, Log loss, F1 score, Precisão, Recall, ROC AUC, AUPRC, Kappa…

Muita coisa né?

Não existe é a métrica perfeita para todos os casos, mas é sua tarefa conhecer o maior número possível e entender como elas podem te ajudar a decidir se o modelo está indo na direção que você quer.

Nesta quarta-feira, às 20h, vou te ensinar as métricas de classificação que foram mais úteis na minha experiência.

Depois desta aula, você terá condições de escolher quais são as métricas mais adequadas para o problema que você quer resolver.

Sem cometer alguns erros que eu cometi e vou compartilhar com você.

Esta é a primeira de (pelo menos) duas aulas onde vou te ensinar sobre métricas. A segunda, na semana que vem, será sobre métricas de regressão."

Digital transformation? Talk about mixed results.

Most organizations embark on their automation and digital transformation journey in silos.

No wonder only a third of initiatives have been successful. 

Yet transformation remains a strategic imperative, and those that are doing it right have a secret weapon.

Successful transformation requires converging your organization's richest assets: data assets, business process automation, and the upskilling of people.

And the biggest secret?

Put automation back into the hands of the users. 

Let them drive outcomes across analytics, data science, and process automation in hours, and see immediate value. 

Watch your transformation, then accelerate across every department.

The technology proven globally to drive transformative outcomes is Analytic Process Automation, or APA. 

It enables the automation of every analytic function and enables the intelligent automation of business processes, including distributing outcomes to stakeholders, triggering action in business applications, and the flexibility to start anywhere.

So anyone in your organization can solve business problems, in a self-service way, without needing any expert skills. 

And when you're looking for inspiration to achieve more business outcomes, an open community forum where users share solutions and continue on their learning paths awaits, bringing more people together to drive outcomes faster. 

Across the globe, thousands of organizations using APA are achieving quick wins and transformative outcomes measured by top-line growth, bottom-line savings, dramatic efficiency gains, and the fast upskilling of workforces. 

Thousands of companies globally are seeing significant ROI and efficiency gains with Analytic Process Automation.

Experience what thousands of other companies have experienced. Discover more at https://www.alteryx.com/apa

732,PyCon 2020,Docker and Python: making them play nicely and securely for Data Science and ML - Tania Allard -Talk,1.0,2020-05-06,UCMjMBMGt0WJQLeluw6qNJuA,3781,,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Jq68axbKIbg/maxresdefault.webp,1920,1080,People & Blogs,,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjMBMGt0WJQLeluw6qNJuA,"Presented by:
Tania Allard

Docker has become a standard tool for developers around the world to deploy applications in a reproducible and robust manner. The existence of Docker and Docker compose have reduced the time needed to set up new software and implementing complex technology stacks for our applications.
Now, six years after the initial release of Docker, we can say with confidence that containers and containers orchestration have become some of the defaults in the current technology stacks.

There are thousands of tutorials and getting started documents for those wanting to adopt Docker for apps deployment. However, if you are a Data Scientist, a researcher or someone working on scientific computing wanting to adopt Docker, the story is quite different. There are very few tutorials (in comparison to app/web) and documents focused on Docker best practices focusing on DS and scientific computing. If you are working on DS, ML or scientific computing, this talk is for you. We’ll cover best practices when building Docker containers for data-intensive applications, from optimising your image build, to ensuring your containers are secure and efficient deployment workflows.

Attendees will leave the talk feeling confident about adopting Docker across a range of DS, ML and research projects.

Why learn Python?

Programmers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. 
Python has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next ""Big Thing"" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.

In this video, I discuss an idea that has been circulating for a while: will data science die in 5 years?  (Or 10 years?)

There are probably three main reasons which are causing this idea to circulate around.  They are:

1)  Automation.  Tools like AutoML from Google and Azure Machine Learning Studio are getting more powerful. 
2)  Hype theory.  There is speculation we have hit a peak of inflated expectations and are descending to a ""trough of disillusionment"".
3)  Companies failing to become data-driven cultures and achieve their intended ROI from analytics.

It is important when we have this discussion though, to keep a few things in mind.

1)  Applied statistics and probability theory have been around since the 17th and 18th centuries.  Hence people have been using these to make business decisions for decades.  Data science was a term that picked up steam around 2010 due to the skyrocketing of computational power.
2)  Data is being collected and generated at exponential rates.  That's just an incredible tool that businesses will not stop leveraging.
3)  Certain organizations DO use data science and AI to great success, and they provide blueprints for organizational success to others.

However there is currently some misleading expectations for data scientists.   This is because of academia and the media excessively hyping ML and AI excessively.  Additionally, organizations occasionally fail to support their data scientists with proper infrastructure, organization, or data.  This can lead also to unrealistic and misleading expectations for data scientists.  These problems are related.

I think we will see a couple solutions in the future.  People will get a bit more specific with ""Data Science"", leading I think to more specialization.  Ultimately successful companies will learn from others -- not all, but some will.  Meanwhile, the rise of AI will enable automation of menial tasks and processes, allowing data science workers in this decade to solve the next, newest, greatest problems.

How to Transition Into Data Science: From Economics to Data Science? Econ majors often want to know how to transition into data science from economics. ✅Get 20% OFF the data science training! https://bit.ly/2x6YK95

In this video we discuss how to transition into data science. Today, we’ll be making the switch from economics and examine the good, the bad and the ugly. We’ll answer some of the most important questions running through your mind, like: “Can I”, “Should I” and “How can I” transition into data science from economics. And we’ll discuss the pros and cons before finding the best way to transition into Data Science.

Let’s start with “Can I make the transition into data science?”. The answer here is a resounding “yes!”. Roughly 13% of current data scientists have an Economics degree. For comparison, the most well-represented discipline is data science and analysis, which takes up 21% of the pie. Therefore, Economics is a competitive discipline when it comes to data science. 

First, unlike STEM disciplines, social studies help develop great presentational skills which are essential for any data scientist. Through presentations and open discussions, students learn how to present a topic, as well as argue for or against a given statement. These activities result in developing a confident and credible way of showcasing actionable insights. Moreover, most econ majors deeply care about human behavior and response to different stimuli.

Furthermore, Economics frequently intertwines with Mathematics, Finance, Psychology, and Politics. Therefore, an economist’s approach is always meant to be interdisciplinary. 

Finally, the technical capabilities of an economist are often quite impressive. An average economist has a good understanding of Machine Learning without really referring to it as such. Linear regressions and logistic regressions are studied in almost all Economics degrees.

In this video I go through how to clean up your data to make it usable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

Data cleaning is an extremely important and often overlooked step in the data science lifecycle. Python has some handy functions that allow you to parse and replace data relatively easily. You can also use regular expressions to do this; however, those are a bit beyond the scope of this video. I mostly use lambda functions because I think that this is the simplest approach.

The first thing that we clean is the data science salary. We need to make sure that it is numeric because we are using that as our dependent variable. We also want to go through and do some light feature engineering. We can get some info about the state of the job postings and the nature of the job postings themselves.

I went through and looked to see if the postings had python, r-studio, spark, aws, or excel listed and added those as features. 

Again, this is an iterative approach that is rather messy. Please stay tuned for part 4 of the series EDA!

In this video I go through how to setup a github repo and collect data for your own data science project.

Data collection can be a tedious and frustrating process, but you don't necessarily have to start from scratch. You should search github to see if someone has already built a web scraper for the website you are looking at. You should also check to see if the website has an open API. 

For this project, I found someone who had written a glassdoor web scraper and I was able to version it for our purposes. The code and the article that I used are linked here:
Code: https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium
Article: https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905

This web scraper was written in python with the selinium package. 

This is an iterative process, so in this video you will see how I go about debugging my code and making it work. 

Stay tuned for part 3 where I go through and clean up the data that we collected to make it usable for our EDA and model building. 

After we scrape the data, I save the code to github.

In this video I go through the planning and idea creation for this new data science project. 

I have gotten quite a few requests to do data science project from scratch. I also left these series mostly unedited so you can see me get stuck and how I figure out the path forward. 

The next phases of the project are, data collection, data cleaning, eda, model building, and productionzation. 

For data science project ideation, you generally have two approaches. You can look through available data on kaggle or google data, or you can come up with an idea and then go out and find your data. In this video, I show you how to do both approaches.

I end up choosing a data science project based on a simple whiteboarding session. We will try to predict data science salaries based on data scraped from glassdoor or linkedin. 

In part 2 I will show you how to scrape your data and how to set up a github repo.

Data Science or Computer Science degree is best for data science? Here we'll discuss whether a Data Science or Computer Science degree is the best choice for you. ✅Get 20% OFF all learning plans! http://bit.ly/33tb1QI

Well, both D-S and C-S are fantastic choices for a concentration, so please don’t feel discouraged if you’ve already chosen one over the other. 
That being said, we here at 365 have conducted research to determine which one is better for a successful career as a data scientist. 

We’ll begin by weighing the pros and cons of earning either degree, starting with D-S. Then, we’ll do some evaluation and head-to-head comparison before picking a winner.

The most obvious pro of getting a Data Science degree is that it’s supposedly the shortest route to becoming a data scientist. 
Having the words “Data Science” next to “education” in your resume is a sure-fire way to get the express treatment when applying for jobs in the field. Thus, the signalling aspect of such a degree is extremely important. 

Of course, the main reason is that potential employers believe you have a great interest in the job. They don’t have to worry about programming skills, analytical understanding of statistical results, or your data-storytelling abilities. This is crucial because some great statisticians lack the coding pedigree, while some programming wonderkids lack the knowledge to extract insights from a dataset. With a Data Science degree, you’re sure to possess all the necessary qualities, without needing outside validation, like extra certification.
However, currently, there is 1 major con when it comes to a Data Science degree – availability.

✅​https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 

Since the field is relatively new, a Data Science program can sometimes be hard to come by, regardless of whether we’re talking undergraduate or graduate programs. The scarcity has resulted in many students having to pick alternative concentrations and, as a result, losing interest in the field prior to graduating...

About the speaker:  
Chris Wiggins is an associate professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University and the Chief Data Scientist at The New York Times. At Columbia he is a founding member of the executive committee of the Data Science Institute, and of the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics as well as the Department of Systems Biology, and is affiliated faculty in Statistics. https://www.linkedin.com/in/wiggins/

About the talk: 
The Data Science group at The New York Times develops and deploys machine learning solutions to newsroom and business problems. Re-framing real-world questions as machine learning tasks require not only adapting and extending models and algorithms to new or special cases but also sufficient breadth to know the right method for the right challenge. The speaker will first outline how unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning methods are increasingly used in human applications for description, prediction, and prescription, respectively. The speaker will then focus on the 'prescriptive' cases, showing how methods from the reinforcement learning and causal inference literatures can be of direct impact in engineering, business, and decision-making more generally."

Why cloud computing is critical for data scientists? If small companies want to level the playing field, cloud computing is critical for their data science teams. ✅Get 20% OFF all learning plans! http://bit.ly/2TVaJ0O

To understand the advantages cloud computing provides when it comes to data science, let’s imagine a world with as much data as we have today, but without servers. In such an unfortunate scenario, firms would need databases that run locally, right? 

So, every time when you, as a data scientist, want to engage in new analyses or refresh an existing algorithm, you’d have to transfer information to your machine from the central database, and then proceed to operate locally. This unfortunate world would have several main drawbacks... 

For example, manual intervention would be necessary to retrieve data... Your machine becomes a single point of failure for the analyses you have worked on locally... Processing speed would be equivalent to the computing power of your computer... Chances are you will be able to work with a limited amount of data due to the limited computing resources at your disposal... Moreover, under this setup, you wouldn’t be able to leverage real-time data to build recommender systems or any type of machine learning algorithms that require ‘live’ data.

Doesn’t sound like the perfect scenario, does it? Well, that’s why we invented servers. And then these servers had drawbacks of their own.

Fortunately, we now have clouds. They overshadow local servers in almost every conceivable aspect. And, in fact, data scientists should be focused on developing great algorithms, testing hypothesis, taking advantage of all available data without having to wait hours to see the results of the tests they are performing and certainly without having to worry how much memory space they have left on their computer. And yes, sometimes data scientists do end up waiting for long hours for an algorithm to train, but with a cloud, they have the option to pay more and get the job done faster. That’s yet another advantage of cloud computing over servers.

Teams like Real Madrid, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, and Juventus keep making people visit their stadiums and buying their jerseys. but, what makes this sport so exciting? 

More than other major clubs, Liverpool incorporates data analysis into the decisions it makes, from the corporate to the tactical. How much that has contributed to its recent performance is itself hard to measure. But whatever the outcome of the final, the club’s ascent has already started to make number-crunching acceptable, even fashionable, in England and beyond.

There are very few college students that land Data Science Jobs right out of school. These are my tips to maximize your university experience and to give you the best career options going forward. 

1) Get as much experience as you can. You can do this through data science internships, projects, or research with your professors. 
2) It doesn't matter what you study if you are comfortable with going back to grad school. If you don't want to go back to school and still want to work in data science, you should study CS, Physics, Math, Statistics, or some other quantitative discipline. 
3) Use your professor's free time. These people have dedicated their lives to their given field and you should learn from them as much as you can. 
4) Use your school network as much as possible. 
5) Do data science projects that interest you and share them. 
6) Join data science clubs or start them. 
7) Go to conferences at the student rate. 
8) Don't stress about it.

So, you want to become a data scientist? Great! Our free step by step guide will walk you through how to start a career in data science: ✅ https://bit.ly/3iSXgBf

According to Glassdoor, 2016 was the first year in which “data scientist” was the ‘Best job’ on the market. And after that? Well, it was in the lead in 2017, 2018, and 2019 as well! With a mean base salary of more than $100,000, being a data scientist seems like the dream job of this century. But why is that?

Of course, like any other business-related phenomenon, it follows the basic laws of economics – supply and demand. The demand for data science professionals is very high, while the supply is too low. 

Think about computer science years ago. The internet was becoming a “thing” and people were making serious cash off it. Everybody wanted to become a programmer, a web-designer or anything, really, that would allow them to be in the computer science industry. Salaries were terrific and it was exceptional to be there. As time passed by, the salaries plateaued as the supply of CS guys and girls started to catch up with the demand. That said, the industry is still above average in terms of pay.

The same thing is happening to the data science industry right now. Demand is really high, while supply is still low. And, as stated in an extensive joint research performed by IBM, Burning Glass Technologies, and Business-Higher Education Forum, this tendency will continue to be strong for the years to come.

This, by itself, determines that salaries will be outstanding. Consequently, people are very much willing to get into data science...

There are plenty of cases where data science could make sense for you. Below are three situations where data science won't be a good fit for you. 

#datascience
1) You are in it for the money
2) You don't like autonomy 
3) You are uncomfortable with collaboration

Data science is an awesome field, but it isn't for everyone. You should not become a data scientist if the three pillars above are relevant to you!

#DataScience #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #DataScienceCareer#DataScienceJobs #ArtificialIntelligenceCareer #MachineLearningCareer #CareerAdvice

If you want to start AI tomorrow there are three things I would say that you should have. One is figuring out what kind of learning do you like? Do you like to learn from a book or do you like watching videos? I like watching videos. When you’re watching videos are you taking notes? Those kinda things, figure out your learning curve, how are you going to do that. Second thing is, find more friends. You can find people in the forums, you can talk to them and see and have this kind of a community wherein you can go to; you can go to data science meetups and meet people who are also the same, following the same paths, struggling to learn, etc.
Then the third thing is, you’re having people who have already gone through this. Have some mentors. I think that really helps a lot. Talking to them will make a lot more sense to you; you would also know where you’re going wrong and you can also say that this is the path I want to learn. There is going to be a lot of clarity which you’re going to get. And the fourth thing that I am going to say is this – Do not get stuck in theory. It has to be hands-on. Unless and until you run your first model, understand and run your first model, it’s ok even if it’s a blackbox, just run it. Even if you don’t understand python, just run it. Download a notebook and just run it on a Google Collab or whatever it is, but just run it. It’s OK. Be more hands-on. Only then you’ll learn a lot more. So, 3 things: Figure out the course, whatever you want to do; have a support structure of friends, forums, etc have couple of mentors or a mentor who is going to help you out and the fourth thing, Be HandsOn, do more projects. I would say that breaking into data science is just equivalent to breaking into software engineering for someone who does not have that kind of background. To split it down into atomic parts, I would say that you need to be passionate about that field, you need to get a strong hold of the basics, basic technical skills that you require for that field. Apart from that you should probably choose an industry in which you have an inherent interest. For example if you’re interested in Finance, you should look for roles in the financial industry as a data scientist. And apart from that you should have a knack of augmenting your knowledge regularly because it is an ever evolving field so everyday you have new research papers being published, the amazing research that is happening in the AI and the community. And there a new tools that you get to use for implementing your solutions. You should have that sort of curiosity and that sort of drive in you to learn something new each day and keep augmenting your knowledge. If you feel you identify with this kind of a skill set you’re on the right path of transitioning into data science. The thing people still have confusion that anyone can be a data scientist or not. So I will say anyone can be a data scientist. Even I'm mentoring one student, he has absolutely no background of maths and coding and he is doing fine, very good in the data science track."

Hi guys. My name is Neeraj Agrawal. I'm a senior data scientist at Walmart. In today’s video, I'm going to talk about What is data science? What is a data scientist? And then how to get a good job in a great company? And finally I’m going to talk about What is data science salary? How much a data scientist can earn? So, what is data science? In a layman term, something to learn from data is data science.  
 A guy who learns from data can learn from data is a data scientist. What data science comprises of? I think that you need a mathematics background. You should be a good statistician. You should have a good knowledge of statistics. You should be good at machine learning. Other than that, taking data science space as a whole. We have deep learning experts, in deep learning we have experts in NLP(Natural Language Processing) and we have experts in computer vision. company always looks that one should have good programming skills. It can be in python, it can be java or any other language and you should be good at making algorithms. Companies also look for someone who has a good mathematical background If somebody gave you a research paper to read can you read those papers.the reason we need a person who knows a little bit of probability and statistics. And finally, he should be knowing the basics of machine learning algorithms. The question is how to apply for the data scientists’ job?For instance, if you are not getting a project in your company then you have to build your programming skills very strong,  work on some of the projects like Kaggle competition or as a part of some courses and then you can bring your potential on the table. Finally, let’s talk about the data scientists’ salaries. This is a hot topic & one thing that I have observed,  people are moving into this field because of salary. There are three categories of people, the first one is who is starting from scratch. It's always good to enter into this field as early as possible because definitely you will have to compete with the person who is data scientist for 10 years and you have domain expertise of 10 years in your field then you have a 2 years of experience in a data science field and to match that salary it will be little tough but also data scientist salary depends on other factors like which companies you are targeting like there are some big companies & some startups and also some mid-range companies are there . Based on company you are targeting your salary will depend, so you cannot say that you have 5 years of experience - I should get a certain amount of salary but as a whole  if you are a fresher or someone with 2-3 year of experience then  you can expect in the range from 10-20 LPA or something like that and if you are really a bright guy and you are really working on data structures algorithms and all the things I am talking about you can expect little more and if you have 5-10 year experience it means you are a gem, so you can expect in the range of 30-40 LPA and more."

In this tutorial, we’ll talk about the Chi-Squared Distribution and its characteristics. 

For starters, we define a denote a Chi-Squared distribution with the capital Greek letter Chi, squared followed by a parameter “k” depicting the degrees of freedom. Therefore, we read the following as “Variable “Y” follows a Chi-Square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom”.

Very few events in real life follow such a distribution. In fact, Chi-Squared is mostly featured in statistical analysis when doing hypothesis testing and computing confidence intervals. In particular, we most commonly find it when determining the goodness of fit of categorical values. That is why any example we can give you would feel extremely convoluted to anyone not familiar with statistics…

Vous avez tous entendu parler de Data Sciences mais vous vous demandez encore ce que cela peut bien être et ce qui se cache derrière ce concept. C’est vrai qu’avec la foison d’informations qui sont diffusées par les médias ou disponibles sur internet on a un peu de mal à faire la part des choses concernant cette approche multidisciplinaire émergente. On trouve un peu tout et n’importe quoi sur ce domaine. Pas de panique, je vais essayer de vous aider à y voir plus clair et tenter de vous expliquer tout cela de la façon la concise et la plus simple qui soit. 

Les Data Sciences, ou sciences des données en Français, regroupent en fait un ensemble de disciplines dont la vocation est de produire des connaissances à partir d’informations de nature et de source diverses que l'on appelle données - d'où le mot data présent dans data sciences."

Кстати, меня зовут Шванов Вадим, и я программист на языке C# уже больше 8 лет, а также я являюсь автором ресурсов для разработчиков CODE BLOG. На этом канале я рассказывают про IT, технологии и веду курс C# с нуля под названием Учим Шарп. В его рамках мы рассматриваем язык программирования c# с нуля, синтаксис, структуры данных, алгоритмы, паттерны проектирования и многое другое. Эти уроки c sharp подойдут для начинающих и для тех кто хочет подробнее изучить платформу .net и среду разработки visual studio. Для меня важно не только показать практическое применение языка си шарп и платформы dotnet, но и  объяснить базовые идеи программирования. Уроки с# выходят как минимум два раза в неделю в понедельник и четверг в 20-00. C# курс рассчитан на то, чтобы изучить программирование с нуля. Все занятия веду я сам - опытный программист c#. Разработка ведется в IDE visual studio c#. Подписывайтесь, впереди еще много интересного и полезного об it, программировании как для начинающих, так и для более опытных программистов c#.

Does that mean it's better to become a data scientist than a web developer? Become a data scientist today: https://engineeredtruth.com/DataCamp

Though data scientists do get paid more, they require a much higher level of education and most have a master's degree (88%). It's a lot easier to get a web developer job especially if you're looking for remote positions or to work for a smaller company.

Also, web development is more tangible making it an easier subject to learn.

I provide 5 questions that you should ask yourself that will assess your fit for the field. 

#DataScience #DataScienceJobs #DataScienceCareers

Questions to Ask Yourself:
- Am I prepared to seriously commit to learning? Data Science has a steep learning curve. You also have to invest in learning after getting a job or finishing school.

- Can you identify problems and seek out solutions? People will not tell you how to solve every problem. You have to be creative enough to identify problems and generate custom solutions to them

- Do you have an aptitude for math? The foundation of data science is in math. You need to be comfortable with this to excel in the field.

- Are you interested in computer science and programming? Most day to day data science work requires programming. You must be comfortable learning these techniques. 

- Do you have a knack for story telling and explaining complex concepts in simple terms? You commonly have to explain your findings to business holders. If you cannot put your findings in their terms, they will likely not use your work.

How to Become a Data Analyst in 2020? That’s right – we’ll talk about becoming a data analyst in 2020! More specifically, we’ll look at who the data analyst is, what they do, how they fare in terms of salaries, and what skills and academic background you need to become one. Our free step by step guide will walk you through how to start a career in data science: https://bit.ly/2DGvmt2 to find out or watch this video, in which we’ll talk about an alternative way of getting into data science.

Who is the data analyst exactly?
Data analysts are the real troopers of data science. They’re the ones who are involved in gathering data, structuring databases, creating and running models, and preparing advanced types of analyses to explain the patterns in the data that have already emerged. A data analyst also overlooks the basic part of predictive analytics.

That’s the “elevator pitch of the data analyst”. But to really get an idea of what it means to be part of a team like that, we need to look at what a data analyst does. 

As it turns out, quite a lot. A data analyst is both a thinker and a doer who doesn’t hesitate to roll up their sleeves and dig into the numbers. Data analysts extract and analyze data with a “can do” approach and then present data-driven insights to underpin decision making. They also develop and build analytics models and approaches as the basis for a company’s strategy and vision. On top of that, they are often responsible for identifying and extracting key business performance, risk and compliance data, and converting it into easy-to-digest formats. So, as you can see, agility to shift between strategic projects and operational activities a must.

If you think that sounds a bit lonely… Think again! Data analysts are great team players and work closely with various departments and leaders within the organization. That’s super important if they want to be effective in this role. So, the ability to communicate well and influence is critical here…

Discover the best data science startups to work for in 2020... or read the full article: http://bit.ly/38y6GN6

Before you start sending out your resume to Bain and McKinsey, consider our list of the Best Data Science Startups to Work For in 2020!

Why work for a data science startup?
 
Sure, big data science consultancies have the stability and the benefits every aspiring data scientist strives for. However, you may find yourself working on predictable and often repetitive tasks with little opportunities for growth. At least for the first few years.

Startups, on the other hand, allow you to develop your skillset by trying new things and handling a variety of challenges. Responsibilities there change quite frequently. So, within less than a year you could be doing something entirely different… And a lot more interesting for you than what you were initially hired for. In other words, the sky is the limit!

We based our research on insight from KDnuggets, LinkedIn, and Forbes to discover the best startups to watch in 2019. Then we picked our top 10 – the fastest growing machine learning and tech startup companies that give you both development opportunities, and a chance to work on inspiring projects.

So... watch our data science startups review to learn what they do, where to apply, and why you should consider working there. And don’t mind the order – these startups are so unique, that every single one of them could easily be number 1 on our list.

Enjoy watching!

In this tutorial we are going to discuss the Poisson distribution.

When we measure the occurrences of an event over a certain period of time or distance, we are often left wondering if what we observe is surprising. The Poisson Distribution helps us determine the likelihood of specific discrete outcomes based on a given historical average number of occurrences. For instance, we know that the average firefly lights up 7 times over the course of 20 seconds. With this distribution we can determine the extent to which it will be out of the norm if it lights up only 4 times during that interval. Being able to spot unusual frequencies of recurring events will help us determine whether something is worrisome or not and if we should further investigate the problem.

Speaker: Hadley Wickham
Date: 6/20/2019

Abstract

Functional programming (FP) provides a rich set of tools for reducing duplication in your code. The goal of FP is to make it easy to express repeated actions using high-level verbs. I think that learning a little about FP is really important for data scientists, because it's a really good fit for many problems that you'll encounter in practice.

In this talk, I'll introduce you to the basics of functional programming in R, using the purrr package. I'll begin by briefly dissecting the for loop that you're already familiar with, then continue to show why functional programming provides elegant alternatives. I'll next dive into two examples showing where FP is particularly useful in data science: when ingesting unruly datasets spread across multiple files, and producing multiple reports for different stakeholders.

You'll get the most out of this talk if you're familiar with R, or you've done data science in other languages like Python.

#DataScience #DataScienceJobs #DataScienceInternship
Highlights:
- Plan your resume carefully, put your tech skills up top and highlight your project experience. Try to do multiple projects, one for regression, one for classification, one for clustering, and one using either deep learning or gradient boosted random forest. Also, customize your resume and message for each interview.
- Practice telling your story. Know why you want to work as a data scientist and why you want to work at a specific company. do your homework on company news and history. This can get you to the next round.
- Don't freak out over a coding interview or a problem analysis set. Companies don't expect too much from interns. They just want to know that you have baseline abilities. If you want to impress them, use an ensemble model or use some feature engineering. 
- In person, speak about the outcomes of your projects. Make sure you communicate why you worked on them and the potential value they could create for a business.

1) Data wrangling is a bigger part of the job than many expect. Learn SQL and be efficient with manipulating data in Python or R.

2) You don't always get to work on projects that are exciting to you. In school you choose many of the data sets and projects that you do. Almost universally, at work, your day to day projects are dictated by your boss.

3) You can learn a tremendous amount from other people. Data Scientists are incredibly smart and come from a range of backgrounds. 

4) Data science is constantly growing. With the field being broadly defined, there is almost a limitless amount of things to learn.

5) Office politics do play a role in data science. If you are interested in management after data science, it could be good to know who makes the strategic decisions. 

6) Data science is very different at different companies depending on the size and growth phase of the organization.

7) Put some time into learning implementation frameworks (Docker & Sagemaker)

8) Statistical significance plays a different role in the business setting. If the expected value is positive, you should at least try it.

curadoria de luis felipe pondé
módulo: “o mundo contemporâneo repleto de adultos infantis” | o amadurecimento se torna cada vez mais raro. os jovens adiam sair de casa, ser autossuficientes financeiramente, sustentar vínculos afetivos e ter filhos. para muitos especialistas há uma epidemia de infantilização. este módulo do café filosófico cpfl discutirá essa epidemia de imaturidade como sintoma de um mundo contemporâneo inconsistente.

cada vez mais delegamos um volume maior de decisões aos algoritmos. permitiremos que eles se tornem responsáveis por escolhas mais importantes e estratégicas, como em que empresa vamos trabalhar ou em qual candidato votaremos nas próximas eleições, ou vamos nos rebelar contra o poder das companhias que detêm os códigos de programação? o futuro datacêntrico será capaz de produzir níveis mais elevados de bem-estar social?

Sin embargo, las altas expectativas que genera, tanto en las personas como en las organizaciones, ha hecho que se malentienda su rol. Ese malentendimiento ha causado situciones como las siguientes: que se ofrezcan trabajos titulados como Data Scientist (o relacionados), que en realidad no lo son; que aún cuando el rol esté definido, no exista la infraestructura necesaria para su quehacer; o que la cultura organizacional no tenga la madurez necesaria para ser ""orientada a los datos"" o data-driven.
 
Como consecuencia tenemos personas con trabajos frustrantes y lugares de trabajo que pierden tiempo y dinero por seguir tendencias por moda. 

En esta charla se describirá estas situaciones y propondrá tips para que las personas puedan detectar cuando algo huele mal, y las empresas puedan definir correctamente qué necesitan, a quién, y cómo aprovechar los datos."

So, you want to become a data scientist? Great! Our free step by step guide will walk you through how to start a career in data science: https://bit.ly/324HX1R Data science is a super-hot topic and it is the most promising job of 2020. But what do you need to become a data scientist in 2020?

Along with this question, you probably want to find out whether your skills are appropriate for this field, what steps you need to take to become a successful data scientist, and if your background will affect the chances of becoming a data scientist. All valid questions!

So, to help you answer your questions, we examined 1,001 linked LinkedIn resumes of people who are currently working as data scientists to see where exactly they come from and what skills they’re using in their day-to-day activities.
 
The main messages we extracted from our study both last and this year, is that if you have the skill base that makes a data scientist, you can be a data scientist. It will be interesting to see how the data science profession changes in the next 2-5 years, but right now, a universal data scientist profile appears to be taking shape: a unique programming language toolbox desired across industries and locations; preferably a Master’s degree, or a Bachelor’s and proof of practical abilities; and a confident learning-on-the-go attitude are the currencies of the field.

Data Analyst does a lot of descriptive analytics. On the other hand, Data Scientist also does descriptive analytics. But also data scientists do something called
predictive analytics.

So let's try to understand what Descriptive and Predictive analytics mean.


Descriptive Analytics is all about analyzing the historical data to answer this particular question which is ""WHAT HAS HAPPENED TILL NOW??"".


Predictive Analytics also involves analysis of historical data but, predictive analytics is mainly all about answering the question 
which is.. ""WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE??""

Let's understand this with a simple example.
I have sales data of XYZ company in a table format.

As part of descriptive analytics, we can simply create a scatter chart so that we can quickly understand how the company has been performing
in terms of sales in the previous years.

Now let's look at predictive analytics. So now that we know how the company has been performing in the previous years, can we predict what's gonna 
happen to the sales in the coming years?.. Will the sales increase, or decrease or does it remain the same??.. 
If we are able to answer these questions, then it is called as predictive analytics.

So coming back to the comparison of Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles, 
Now that we have some idea about the differences between the two roles, lets now look at skills needed for each of these two roles.

Data Analysts should be good with Math and Statistics.
They should be good with handling the data.
 -- This includes knowledge of ETL (or Extract Transform and Load) operations on data and experience working with popular
 ETL tools such as Informatica – PowerCenter,IBM – Infosphere Information Server, alteryx,
 Microsoft – SQL Server Integrated Services (SSIS), Talend Open Studio, SAS – Data Integration Studio
 ,SAP – BusinessObjects Data Integrator, QlikView Expressor or any other popular ETL tool.
 -- They should be comfortable in handling data from different sources and
 in different formats such as text, csv, tsv, excel, json, rdbms and others popular formats.
 -- They should have excellent knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language).

 Its a Bonus to have 
 -- The knowledge of Big data tools and technologies to handle large data sets.
 -- NoSQL databases such as HBase, Cassandra and MongoDB.
They should be expert in Analysing and Visualizing the data.
 -- They Should have experience working with popular data analysis and visualization packages in python and R 
    such as numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, ggplot and others.
 -- Experience with popular data analysis and visualization BI tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, SAP BI, SAS BI, Oracle BI, QlikView or any other 
 popular BI tool
They should have good communication and storytelling skills.


Lets now look at the skills needed for data scientist role.

Data scientist also does descriptive analytics just like data analysts. Apart from that, they also do predictive analytics.

So as part of Descriptive analytics:
Data Scientists should be excellent with Math and Statistics.
Data scientists should be good with handling data
 -- So yes, they should have experience working with popular ETL frameworks.
 -- They should have excellent knowledge of SQL.
 -- Many companies expect data scientists to have mandatory knowledge of big data tools and technologies to 
    work with large datasets and also to work with structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. 
 -- Its good to have the knowledge of NoSQL databases such as HBase, Cassandra and MongoDB.
They should be expert in Analysing and Visualizing the data.
 -- Experience working with popular data analysis and visualization packages in python and R.
 -- Experience with popular data analysis and visualization BI tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, SAP BI, SAS BI, Oracle BI, QlikView or any other 
 popular BI tool.
They should also have excellent communication and storytelling skills.

And as part of predictive analytics, 
They should be good in using the techniques in artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and statistical modeling to make
   future predictions using the historical data.
Exposure to popular predictive analytics tools such as SAP Predictive analytics, Minitab, SAS Predictive Analytics, Alteryx Analytics, IBM 
    predictive analytics or any other popular predictive analytics tool.
They should have very good exposure to popular machine learning and deep learning packages available for Python and R such as 
    scikit learn, tensorflow, theano,rpart, caret, randomForest, nnet, and other popular libraries."

Decision tree is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms in use today, this is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classifying problems. It works well classifying for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets based on the most significant attributes/ independent variables. In simple words, a decision tree is a tree-shaped algorithm used to determine a course of action. Each branch of the tree represents a possible decision, occurrence or reaction. Now let us get started and understand how does Decision tree work.

Below topics are explained in this Decision tree in R tutorial :
1. What is Decision tree?
2. What problems can be solved using Decision Trees?

Kaggle, on the other hand, is an amazing platform for those who wanted to learn Machine Learning by doing it. While we perform Machine Learning on the data provided by #Kaggle, sometimes it's hard to work with that data in our local system, so solve this problem you can make use of Google Colab. Using Google Colab, you will be able to run all your ML queries using the free RAM and Disk space provided by Google. The Disk space provided by Google is temporary, so it's always a good idea to keep the data into Google Drive and work on Colab using the data from the drive. 

#Kagglecompetition
This video explains the process of getting the data directly from the Kaggle website to your Google Drive account. Once you have the data into the google drive, you can make use of it for your project.

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews Rachael Tatman for the second time!

This interview is a continuation of the same, Rachael was earlier at Kaggle, and they start the interview by talking about her work at Kaggle, and her involvement with the community's contribution towards her journey. 

Later, shifting gears into her role today, which is a developer advocate at Rasa: What exactly does a Developer Advocate mean? 

Rachael also shares many interesting opinions on conversational AI, her opinion of the state of conversational AI in 2020, and many great interesting project ideas for any of you that's interesting in building projects out using Rasa, or otherwise, for anyone who's seeking ideas 

They talk about her process of content creation, and if you watch any of our streams, they also discuss how does she brings so much positivity and so much energy to all of our streams.

Years ago, he was a Masters student working on quantum computing in Japan. The online course 'Zero to GANs' not only helped him to test various models and concepts, it also made Rémi try new techniques, like the cross validation technique. Though he had secured the first spot in the Kaggle competition for a few hours, he eventually was a part of the top 1% of the participants. His real victory, as he says, was in the fact that Jovian's hands-on course allowed him to challenge himself and share not only code but also learnings and insights with his community.

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews three people from the kaggle team: Phil Culliton, who's on the data science team at Kaggle, Maggie Demkin: who's on the customer success and business development team, and Addison Howard, who's a programme manager at Kaggle. 

They talk a lot about what happens behind the scenes at kaggle, Including a very interesting Gladiator fight. Please stay tuned! ;) 

They talk mainly about what happens from the start to the ending of the competition. How does a competition really come to its life? What happens before that, what happens after that, what happens during the duration, on the other side of the team?

The team also shares many amazing stories, their favourite memories from hosting these competition, their overview of kaggle and the community.

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Note: Correction: At 7:35: Heads or Tails' Kaggle avatar is the spiral galaxy M101, which has the nickname 'Pinwheel galaxy', not 'Whirlpool galaxy' 

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews the First #Kernel #GrandMaster on #Kaggle: ""Heads or Tails"": Martin Henze. 

In this interview, they talk about his journey into data science, his transition from astronomy, astronomy involves a lot of looking up to the skies and trying to figure out through data what's out there, and as you might imagine, many parallels are drawn between astronomy and data science and Martin's approach to creating the amazing kernels. 

They also discuss his transition into doing data science during the day. 

Personal Note: There are a lot of rich hidden golden advices for people that are working towards sharing their kernels on Kaggle.

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews legendary Kaggle GrandMaster: Mark Landry. 

They talk all about Mark's journey into machine learning: 

How he got interested in machine learning? How did he discover Kaggle? His addiction for Kaggle? How his approach on Kaggle has evolved over all of these years that he's been active on the platform?

They talked about his journey at h2o: he's been at h2o.ai for a few years now. They also talk about auto ML, we reveal interesting story: AutoML at h2o.ai was originally called AutoMarkLandry. And there's a lot of discussion around data science on and off Kaggle, how to approach Kaggle or data science problems. 

This one is all about data science, Kaggle, and h2o.ai but it's true to the three words, they talk all about these three words and Mark's journey in all of these three.

Current Machine Learning models are data-hungry, which is different from how human intelligence behaves. In this competition, we are going to create an algorithm that uses a very small training set and is able to reason about what the test output should be.

This is part 1 of a new series on the Kaggle competition Abstraction and Reasoning. In this video, I'll go over the competition objectives, what data is provided, and how we are evaluated.

Step 1: Sign in to google and open Google Colab notebook
Step 2: Install dependencies by executing the following command
            !pip install kaggle
Step 3: Go to your kaggle account and sign in
           ---go to my account option
           ---Now scroll down and there will be an option named ""create new API token""
           ---click on that option and a kaggle.json file will be downloaded
Step 4: Now we have to upload that kaggle.json file in Google colab. We need to run the
            following command:

            from google.colab import files
            files.upload()

  A choose option will appear. Choose the kaggle.json file

Step 5: Now change the directory 
           !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
           !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/

and also change the permission
           !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

Step 6: Now we will import data set. So go to kaggle.com. Sign in and choose any dataset you like. Now accept terms and conditions if there any and copy download API command.


Step 7: Now go back to google colab and paste the command and add ""!"" exclamation mark as a prefix and run it. Wait for a moment and the data set will be downloaded in a zip file.

Step 8: Since the dataset is in zip file, we need to extract it. To do that first we need zip file pacakages.
          !pip install zip_files

Step 9: Now extract the file by using the following code
           from zipfile import ZipFile
           file_name=""your_file_name.zip""
           with ipfile(file_name,'r') as zip:
                  zip.extractall()
                  print('Done')
That's it. Your file will be extracted."

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Read on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the ""Join Competition button to create an account and gain access to the competition data. Then check out Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!

The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

In this episode, Sanyam Bhutani interviews the CEO of Kaggle: Anthony Goldbloom. 

Anthony has a background in economics and has been working on Kaggle, working on the other side of Kaggle as the CEO and co founder for almost over a decade now, 

They talk about his journey as the co founder of Kaggle,  and even Kaggle's journey broadly speaking over the few past few years. How Kaggle has evolved, how their perspective, how their team's perspective on Kaggle and the team itself has evolved from the start until the point even after it got acquired by Google. 

This interview shares a lot of insights about the behind the scenes work that goes into Kaggle while hosting a competition, broadly speaking, or even putting out a new course on Kaggle learn.

They also discuss Kaggle's future plans and what's next and exciting for us as frequent Kagglers.

You’ve got more than one model that you’ve trained up, and you can only choose one of them… which one do you pick? And what information do you use to make that decision? Selecting a model based on the best performance on a loss metric can work really well in some cases, but if you want to move from competitions to deploying models professionally, there are other factors you’ll need to consider.

From December 3-5, 2019, we’re running a practical model evaluation workshop focused on answering these questions and more. During the workshop I’ll walk you through:

Deciding what factors are most important for your project
Training models to evaluate using different autoML systems
Selecting the best model based on which factors are most important to you
You’ll get daily emails with links to notebooks and exercises as well as daily live streams where you can ask questions and get feedback.

In the words of Stanford professor and machine learning guru Andrew Ng, ""Applied machine learning"" is basically feature engineering.”  

In this tutorial I will walk you through some basic feature transformations we can do on the Kaggle Titanic machine learning problem that should improve the model.  

There are essentially endless things that you can do in feature engineering, and it is that feature engineering that sets the great models apart from the ones that are just OK."

The random forest is an easy to use, adaptable, and robust to overfitting machine learning model.  It is also highly capable for classification problems and thus a great choice for this Kaggle. 

The random forest is a collection of decision trees that are bootstrapped through random selection with replacement.  I recommend also checking out these videos on the decision tree model from KNIME data scientist Rosaria Silipo.

About the presenter:
Jean-Francois Puget (IBM, #43 on Kaggle) shared his tricks for feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization. This included general tips and an overview of more competition-specific ideas from Kaggle. The main objective was to use feature engineering as possible (even if you fail at times), including using deep learning to generate new features and to avoid ensembling too early in the competition.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

This video will use Machine Learning techniques to predict the survivability of passengers in a given test data set by building a ML Model based on certain features of the passengers."

About Pavel:
“I am a deep learning engineer at Samsung AI Center Moscow. Also, I’m studying at the Higher School of Economics at the faculty of Computer Science. Previously, I worked on Yandex (Russian search engine) for 1,5 years as a developer of a distributed system for keeping and processing a large amount of data. I love traveling, fishing and challenges in deep learning. I think Kaggle gives us an opportunity to learn things very fast and test our knowledge on practice having a ready task, so, I can’t stop spending all of my free time on competitions.”

Где же взять этот опыт применения машинного обучения на реальных «взрослых» задачах? Тут нам на помощь приходит сервис Kaggle со своей облачной средой разработки/выполнения и действительно крутым сообществом Data Science инженеров. На примере участия в двух соревнованиях, мы расскажем что это такое, как извлечь максимум пользы, и зачем оно вообще нужно.

This video shows you how to participate in Kaggle competitions, specifically the Oxford 102 Flowers Pytorch in class competition (Pytorch classifier). It walks you through the way you could use Kaggle kernels and how to upload your data to a competition. This video was designed to the people who were involved in the Pytorch challenge offered by Udacity and Facebook, who have already trained their model to classify 102 types of flowers and want to see how much they can score on the leaderboard of Kaggle competition. It can benefit you even if you were not one of the Pytorch Challenge participants since we cross through few problems and we solve them on the fly. Recommended if you would like to have an idea of how a Kaggle competition is designed.

Учебный курс ""Программирование глубоких нейронных сетей на Python"" - https://www.asozykin.ru/courses/nnpython

Kaggle - это самый популярный сайт для специалистов по машинному обучению и Data Science. На сайте размещаются соревнования по машинному обучению, наборы данных, примеры кода (kernels) и дискуссии по машинному обучению.

Работодатели часто смотрят профиль соискателя на Kaggle, поэтому важно участвовать в соревнованиях и развивать свой профиль. 

Соревнования по распознаванию рукописных цифр MNIST достаточно простое, поэтому удобно начинать участие в соревнованиях на Kaggle именно с него. 

Для распознавания рукописных цифр мы будем использовать сверточную нейронную сеть, написанную на Keras.

HANDLE LARGE IMAGE DATASETS LIKE A DATA SCIENTIST

In this kaggle tutorial you'll be learning how to handle large image datasets in kaggle like a data scientist! We'll be using jupyter notebooks, when you create your kaggle kernel you'll also going to be using a jupyter notebook. 

If you never heard of jupyter notebook you can checkout the site docs here
https://jupyter.org/
jupyter notebook are a great tool to make shareable and replicable code, a jupyter notebook was used on the LIGO research, how cool is that? They grew in popularity as well as anaconda ( python library manager ) , one thing great about jupyter notebook is that you can publish your jupyter notebook on github and your jupyter notebook will be rendered in the page, pretty cool :D 

But let's go to the facts. Handling large image datasets in kaggle competitions can be a pain sometimes, even if you follow a kaggle tutorial ( usually a jupyter notebook btw ).

But don't you worry! This is the time where we get our hands on working with this nasty little things in those awesome kaggle competitions!

If you don't know kaggle at all, you can check out their website here
https://www.kaggle.com/
It's a great place to get started, you can use the kaggle kernels and kaggle tutorials as guide 
You can check out the kernels ( kaggle tutorial ) here
https://www.kaggle.com/kernels
If you want to create your own Kernel you'll problably want to get familiar with jupyter notebook :D. 

You could also go to a competition that you've liked and search for a specific kaggle tutorial on them
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions
kaggle also has a discussion part, you can find some kaggle tutorial in this section as well
https://www.kaggle.com/discussion

In this kaggle discussion section you can find kaggle tutorial like this one 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/crowdflower-weather-twitter/discussion/6046

You can also participate into discussions to get medals, this will get you ranked on the kaggle website. You can get ranked by posting new kernels ( like a kaggle tutorial ), or you could help some one on the discussion forum. Or you could participate into competions. 
Kaggle has 5 levels in all of the above, kaggle competition, kaggle discussion and kaggle kernel ( kaggle tutorial )

#1 Novice
#2 Contributor 
#3 Expert
#4 Master
#5 Grandmaster 

Also, when you create your own kaggle tutorial and see the feedback of the community this will help you grow as a data scientist into the community, you can check out the new state of the art models that are used in this kaggle tutorials.
